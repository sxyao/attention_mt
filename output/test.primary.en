as steve lopez , <unk> <unk> , the morning , a day of the streets in los angeles , he was a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who was a <unk> <unk> , just two strings .
many of you know , the story of the story , because of the <unk> , it was written by a book , which was called a book , with robert <unk> <unk> , as steve <unk> , and jamie <unk> , who was <unk> in his <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> and 30 years later , he was a <unk> <unk> in the streets of the <unk> , in los angeles .
i 'm going to read you all of the <unk> , and the movie , you do n't know the wonderful relationship that that is between these two men , but also how the music that helped make it and the instrument that it was , and how to
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the disney disney , the <unk> <unk> .
he had a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and fourth symphony , and the stage is to imagine what i 'm going to imagine .
he talked about a very <unk> and <unk> <unk> tv and hillary clinton , and the dodgers never had to be able to create the <unk> world in the <unk> world , and that all of the most important <unk> <unk> in the last sentence of the <unk>
we went to the theme of music , and a few days later , i got a email that was in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> for me .
i have to mention that <unk> <unk> medical treatment , because he was already with <unk> and with the <unk> and the <unk> , a trauma that has been going to be a <unk> life .
as a result of it , it 's particularly vulnerable to these <unk> , and it 's sometimes bad , and he kept in the streets of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in this case , as a <unk> , when we started with our first <unk> , the first <unk> <unk> <unk> , he had seen this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and lost completely lost .
he talked about invisible <unk> and smoke and how he wants to sleep in the sleep .
i was afraid , but i was afraid , but i was afraid that i could lose it in a <unk> , and i could give him his relationship to the <unk> , when i started to talk about it , and and more importantly , the other new
so i started to play .
i was the first sentence of <unk> .
and while i was playing , i realized that in the moment , i was a full change of a whole change .
it was when he was under the effect of the invisible drug , a chemical response , which was a <unk> of my game .
and the <unk> <unk> , in the sense , in a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and how through a miracle he took his violin and started to hear a few <unk> from the <unk> , and asked me to be able to play it , and i said , `` well , more , more , more .
we started to talk about music , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and all the other , to all of the other , to be more honest .
and i realized that he did n't just know a <unk> knowledge about music , but it 's also with a very intimate personal relationship .
he talked about one passion and a understanding of that , i know , i 'm going to tell you my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by he music and music was about music , it was a <unk> , confused man , who was the streets of los angeles , in the streets , a <unk> , and she was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for <unk> , music is <unk> .
because the music allows him to be his thoughts and delusions with human imagination and creativity in something in real circumstances .
and so he 's going to be <unk> in his <unk> .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
so this is why we 're doing music , so we 're going to make something that we 're in all of us , our emotions , through our artistic lens through our creativity .
and the reality is that the expression of us all , and move , and <unk> .
what <unk> <unk> is that he took the music back into a community of friends .
the force of the music took him back to a family of musicians , the mind that he had to be understood and he was <unk> .
and i 'm going to start with <unk> music , no whether it 's in disney disney , or in the <unk> , because he reminds me why i was musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert <unk> .
robert <unk> : i want to play something that i 've been stolen to have .
i hope you 're ashamed .
so i 've been in my life many fish .
i just loved two loved .
this first , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , and it 's good , good , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what 's a fish .
and yet , he was going to be considered in the highest highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that it would be a <unk> .
i had this beauty of a relationship for several months .
one day , the ceo of the company was asked , and i wondered if i was a event of the <unk> of the farm .
`` well , i said , `` well , i 'm going to be .
here was a company that was trying to solve this incredible problem for our chefs , how do we do fish ?
in the last 50 years , we 've seen the oceans as we were <unk> .
it 's hard to change the destruction .
90 percent of the great fish that we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing to have .
so , it 's going to be true , or the <unk> , , for a part of our future .
many of the problems , it 's also the environment that most of them are , and they 're inefficient , we 're <unk> . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 .
that means , 15 pounds of <unk> are required to get a <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it does n't work very good .
so here was a company that was trying to do it .
i wanted to tell you .
the day was the <unk> of the <unk> of the company , the <unk> of the company .
let 's call it a clear .
`` <unk> '' said , `` just just to the facts , you 're famous to be in the sea , that 's not the environment . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out of the waste of our fish , not focused on . ''
and then he 's going to be able to do it , `` we 're basically a own world .
this is the first part of the <unk> , he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
and for one , great .
`` what does you mean ? '' what does you mean ? ''
`` sustainable proteins '' said he said .
`` great '' , i said .
and i was in the bed , and i thought , `` what is hell that 's a sustainable protein ?
so i rang the next day , just the event , the event .
i said , `` well , what are you going to do for example ? ''
he said he did n't know he 's not going to go .
now , i 'm a couple of people in the company , nobody could give me an ad answer , until i finally got to be with the <unk> of the <unk> .
we call it a clear thing .
`` <unk> '' said , `` what are you going to do for example ? ''
now , he mentioned some algae and some of them , and he said , `` he 's going to be married .
i said , `` well , `` dear ? ''
he said , `` yes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and it 's also <unk> . ''
i said , `` how much of the same is chicken ? ''
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what is sustainable to do ? ''
there was a long time in the middle and he said , `` there 's just a lot of chicken on the world . ''
i 'm going to tell you from this fish .
no , because i 'm a more successful , and i 'm going to be a norm .
i 'm even going to be able to do .
no , i 've been working in this fish , because i swear to god , the fish of this conversation , the chicken <unk> .
this second fish is a different way of the way .
it 's the romantic way that you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
i 've got to put it in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a <unk> journalist was a long time for this fish .
she 's a <unk> <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had to be <unk> .
wait .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can be a fish so good , so after he was going to be <unk> ?
i ca n't do it , but this guy can be .
call it miguel . actually , he 's miguel .
and no , he 's not a <unk> , and he 's not a chef , at least the way you know , and i understand it .
he 's a biologist in the <unk> of <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the middle of the middle of the world .
you 're close to the <unk> of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the hands .
they were <unk> to the <unk> , which basically <unk> .
they did that by the country .
they built these complicated series of <unk> , and they 're leaving water from the country and the river .
well , they could n't make it that was that , not economically economically .
and <unk> was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds that are going to be a lot of birds .
and so , in 1982 , a spanish company has been <unk> with the country .
what did they do ?
they have the river of the water .
they have literally <unk> the <unk> .
instead of the water , they used the channels to get the water back to the water .
they 're all the channels .
they created a <unk> <unk> <unk> , three , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> and its company the ecological destruction completely disappear .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen anything .
they 're looking at the horizon , the one million miles away , and everything you see is the same channels and these <unk> , <unk> .
i was n't just a long time with perfection .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of darwin and a part of the <unk> .
okay ? and we were fighting and <unk> , and i 've got to get the <unk> and i have to get to my <unk> , and miguel , in a minute , and <unk> .
here he 's a rare <unk> .
now , he 's the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
and here , there 's a pattern of <unk> that it 's called the <unk> of the <unk> .
it turns out that miguel has been the biggest part of his career in the national park in africa .
i asked him to be a <unk> .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know anything about fish .
i 'm an expert for relationships . ''
and then it goes , and you 're going to be more likely to be more <unk> of rare birds and algae and <unk> .
and i do n't understand that , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , in the way .
it 's great , but i was love .
and my head was weak , this is a little bit of <unk> , which i had to put on the stage .
so i did it . i said , `` miguel , how does it be good ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , the <unk> , the relationships that is incredibly incredible .
but what do you eat ?
how is the consumer ? ''
now , he 's going to tell me that it 's a <unk> system that 's the fish eat the food , which they would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the <unk> , the <unk> , which is what the fish <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it 's totally <unk> .
there are no food .
the one of the farm is not <unk> ?
later , i went on this piece of <unk> , and i asked him , `` i said , `` for a place that 's like to be a place , that 's a <unk> , which i 've been ever been , how do you have it ?
in the moment , if you had a <unk> , it would be a <unk> .
and we took the corner and the <unk> of the most <unk> and thousands of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , so far as far as the eye .
`` this is success . '' he said .
`` look at your <unk> , pink .
they 're going to be <unk> . ''
and i was totally confused .
i said , `` miguel , do n't you get your fish ? ''
`` yes , he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and the <unk> of the birds . ''
now , last year , this has been on the site of 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it 's the largest part of the most important private private interest in europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good job for the last one , you want to be a <unk> ? ''
he was his head , no .
he said , `` we 're not working on it .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> .
so the <unk> is the better the the system . ''
okay , let 's take it . a farm that does n't <unk> the animals , and a farm that has their success to their own <unk> .
but a more , but also , a more successful .
oh , and the way that you should n't be there , it 's not even a way .
they breed in a city where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning , you fly down to the farm .
and every night , you go back to the <unk> miles .
they 're going to do that because they can be the <unk> line of the highway .
seriously .
i had a kind of journey of the penguins , so i would have <unk> .
i said , `` miguel , fly down to the farm and fly back to the night , you go back to the night ?
do you do that for kids ? ''
he looked at me , when i was a song of <unk> <unk> .
he said , `` no . you do that because the food is better . ''
i did n't have the skin of my beloved fish , and i did n't like it . i do n't like it . i do n't like it . i do n't like it .
it 's this kind of <unk> , <unk> .
i do n't want to leave it .
and yet , when i did in this restaurant , you did n't have to be married for the <unk> .
they liked sweet and it 's like if you take a half of the ocean .
i mentioned that <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin looks like a <unk> .
it 's the last <unk> ever before the body .
they 've been in the evolution of evolution , to be <unk> . ''
and then he said , `` but our water has no longer . ''
okay . a farm that does n't <unk> their fish . a farm that has their success to their <unk> .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no longer , it 's a <unk> , because the water that comes through this farm is coming from the river .
it 's a river that all of the things that are coming to the rivers , they 're going to lead to them , chemical pollutants , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and when it comes through the system , it 's water , it 's water as it 's .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm that does n't do their animals , not just a farm who is their success of their own , but a farm that is literally a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but they 're also looking for them .
because the water has to be in the atlantic .
a drop of the ocean , i know , but i 'll take it , because that 's what i do , because this is how romantic also is , and also , it 's also the <unk> .
you might say that it 's a recipe for the future for the future , whether we want to be about the future or more .
what we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , which is in the food of the food .
but for many people , it 's a little bit about radical .
we 're not a <unk> , we 're <unk> . we 're <unk> .
we love we . we love little . we 're talking about food food food . we eat food .
and if you say that the things that the future is the future of people who says someone says , `` hey , hey , i love <unk> <unk> , but how will you feed the world ?
how will you feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , because we have enough calories to make the world more than only .
one billion people will die .
one billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because of the distribution of the distribution , not the gas emissions .
well , i do n't like this question because they 're the logic of our last 50 years of <unk> .
<unk> grain , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the earth , chicken , and the whole time , the <unk> <unk> , `` if we do more than people , how could you be ? ''
this was the <unk> . it was the <unk> . it was the business of american agriculture .
we should call it what it 's , which is a <unk> , a rapid improvement , which is going to be a rapid <unk> , which is the <unk> of the production of the production .
this is not a <unk> , and it 's not agriculture .
our security is not due to our security , because it 's not because of our resources , but because of the resources , it 's not enough .
not through the latest and <unk> , but by <unk> country , not by pumps , but by <unk> water , not by <unk> , but by forests , and they were not through <unk> and nets , but they were
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better how can we create conditions that create any community to feed themselves ?
to do that , you do n't know that for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in the same , and it never has to be something really good for food .
let 's look at the ecological model .
this is that that 's two billion years old .
look at miguel , farmers , <unk> .
companies are not the worlds for these are companies , companies , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the government are not just <unk> , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts .
because they are the ones that are experts .
and if i really really feel really honest , you 're a better chef than i will be .
you know , that 's really right , because if the future is good , it 's delicious .
thank you .
if i want to share a thing that is that the full of the data we consume , we consume more than the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about the information that you think about how we can use information , and we can see that
so what we see here is a typical <unk> of the age of <unk> .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it 's called the <unk> and what i can do with you , that i can be able to be able to be able to get a certain person , and we can say , `` we can get accidents .
and immediately , i see a different pattern that makes it .
and because it 's because in the case , the people are in the most important and they 're going to be here in the u.s .
we can go to a step further and <unk> the data and see that , and the <unk> , the <unk> are not , but not for everyone .
if we go forward and to say , we 're going to say 40 years , and when we see the accidents , we can see the cause of people who are afraid of people .
and who 's true that this is particularly true in men .
so you see that this is the information of information and data in this way , in a particular way , in a particular period of time .
and if we can do this for data , why do n't you make it even content ?
what we 've got here is the <unk> every single single single person ever ever been in .
it 's all there . it 's all online .
you can like to talk to my talk to your <unk> .
you can have a decade in a decade .
you can be able to put it in a particular year .
you can go to a certain copy of a certain game .
if i look at this , i see the <unk> that i think that <unk> and the <unk> .
i 'm a <unk> armstrong fan , so i 'm going to show you what i 've been going to show you about the term of the <unk> session .
now , if i just wanted to get a more <unk> , i think , `` ok , what if i do all the time to go on the subject ? ''
so i 'll go back to a step back and the perspective .
now , i see it .
and so you get a idea of that if you think that you 're going to be a little bit more <unk> , more <unk> , more , more , , but not just , you ca n't just just get it .
you do something that 's a little different .
it 's something between and we think it 's kind of how information can be used .
i want to take this idea a little bit about something about something crazy .
what we 've done is we have every single <unk> , and they 're going to be a little bit of <unk> .
the <unk> is a short <unk> and a symbol of the area .
i just just just want to show the top 500 of the most popular ones .
but even in this way , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we 're going to give you a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i 'm going to get the issue to choose .
now , after i 've been elected , i 've got to know that the most important thing that most of the time is the most <unk> time in the year of the year .
this is really important , because this is a realization that it 's not in a single one .
that 's just when you take a step and look at the whole thing .
and a particular one of this , i can think of the subject of the year , `` people , '' and all of the <unk> .
if i all look at these people , i know that the majority of these are all of us are , some of the science , some of the science , there are a lot of the economy . here 's my boss . and one of the <unk>
and interestingly , a ted prize is a ted prize .
so we can jump up and look at the ted prize .
you can see , we 're looking at the web , the first time as it 's actually a net , not just a net , but a lot of more abstract .
and so i want to tell you what else is a little bit more surprising .
i 'm just going to show you just the new york times .
and for the same , this application -- i want to do it -- it 's not a browser , but you can see websites -- and we can see these two individual website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and just to be a specific <unk> of the <unk> .
this is important because you 're just looking at these different neurons in this way , and that 's the same way that the same way to look at the same way .
so i can zoom in in my way in a particular time .
here 's the whole demonstration of the whole demonstration that i 've been going to go through here .
and i can be able to see everything i 've been looking at today , again .
and when i go back to a step and all of the way , i can see my future , i 've been going to be able to go to my work , and i 've got to say , `` i 've got to go to the <unk>
and i can go into the page and you go back .
it 's a metaphor that will be used to be used , and every time it makes it much bigger than the sum of the sum .
in the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we 're talking about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we 're talking about `` <unk> '' .
what if we could take this situation and the internet on the head , so that we 're going to go from to a other way to go to a lot of things , and then you can see that , what otherwise otherwise would be otherwise ?
if we can do this , we can be able to be able to be able to be able to make a new source of information .
and , instead , just just to move into information , we can get it .
and if we know , we can even know about the way we can do it .
so i hear , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> science science fiction .
in my school school i went to school , every day a day .
and my nose was always in a book , which is my thoughts in other worlds , and in my mind , my deep <unk> , <unk> curiosity .
and this curiosity also found that i was not in school , when i was in the school , the forests , and the <unk> , and <unk> , frogs , frogs and snakes and and , and they were all the time and the microscope , and
i was totally interested , you know .
it was always trying to understand the world and the limits of the way .
and my love science fiction was in my environment , because in the late '60s , we flew the moon and the sea .
jacques cousteau <unk> in our living room with his amazing shows that animals and places and a world of wonders that we could never have imagined before .
that 's what it 's really good to be in the first election .
and i was artists .
i could draw myself . i could paint .
and there 's no video that 's going to be with the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the media , and i had to put the pictures in my head .
we had to all know when we had a book , we took the description of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> in our heads .
my response was to draw the drawing , and paint aliens , aliens , <unk> , <unk> , and all of the things .
in the <unk> , i was constantly going to get the teacher , as i was looking at the <unk> , i 'm going to be <unk> .
the creativity had to get out of it .
and something interesting , what i 've been looking at in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was the idea of a completely unknown world on our planet .
certainly , i would never have to be a aliens in a spaceship , and that seemed pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually see in the earth , and it was also amazing and exotic as all of the things that i had to read was that i had read books .
so i decided to be <unk> , <unk> .
the only problem was that i was in a small village in canada , a few miles from the next ocean .
i did n't get me to do it .
i was my father , until he finally had to be a <unk> in the new york , new york , the other side of the border where we lived .
i was my <unk> in a pool of the winter in the winter in the winter , new york .
the ocean is , the real ocean , i 've got two years later to face the face of california .
since the 40 years , i 've been going to have been talking about three hours of water , 500 hours of time .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the past , the world is so rich , as we can do it .
the idea of nature does n't know what 's happening in our own imagination , to our own imagination .
and for the moment , i 'm going to look at the deepest <unk> that i see on my front .
and my love is the ocean , the same intensity of the same , and the same .
when i was a student , it was the norm .
that seemed the best way to make my inner way to tell stories , to make a <unk> , to create pictures .
as a child , i always started writing the whole book .
so , they were movies , and stories , and stories .
of course , the stories i 've been interested in , and i 'm going to say , `` `` <unk> '' , `` <unk> , '' and `` <unk> . ''
i mean , i could be able to get my preference for the <unk> and the <unk> with the <unk> .
so , i 'm just like my two passions .
something interesting about the word `` <unk> '' : to solve a problem in this film -- and we had to be able to build a kind of liquid <unk> -- that we have to be able to get a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
what was the first time that was the first ever ever ever ever seen in a movie .
the film was not a money , which was just a <unk> , but he was a <unk> , but i realized something fascinating : the audience was the world in the world , like the <unk> of the magic .
according to arthur <unk> , it 's the law of the law , and not to be more different than others .
so you saw something magical .
and that was what i found .
and i thought , `` wow , that must be to be the <unk> of the <unk> . ''
so we went into the terminator , `` the next two , '' i 'm going to go on a lot of time .
together , with the <unk> of the <unk> , we put the <unk> out of liquid metal and the success of the <unk> , that would be the effect of the effect .
and it worked . again , we had something magical . and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we 've got to have a little bit more money .
and these two experiences of the world was a new world , a new world , a new world of creativity .
so i founded a company , with my good friend with the best <unk> , the best of the best election , and she was called `` <unk> . ''
the idea of this company was that the brain is going to use the brain with a lot of techniques , and to start with the digital <unk> , and the same way to begin with the digital process .
and then we did also also have a <unk> of a nuclear weapon .
but the 1990s is that we 've been working in the workforce , and we 've got to be interested in the company , and we had to actually have a <unk> , and we had to start with the <unk> .
i had this piece of mind , which is the <unk> of the <unk> of visual effects and the implications of the whole new <unk> , with the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> people who were involved in the <unk> and the future .
but the <unk> <unk> , and the people in my company said that we were not able to be able to do that .
so i took this other film over the big ship , and it 's going to be the <unk> .
and the first thing i 've been hearing is that as he <unk> and julia <unk> , it was a <unk> <unk> , a passionate movie .
but i wanted to actually be really interested in the actual <unk> of the titanic .
i did n't have the film .
this is the truth . the studio did n't know .
i 've been convinced , i 've been told , `` we 're going to go to the <unk> . we 're going to look at the real <unk> .
we 're going to show it in the <unk> of the movie .
this is hugely important . it 's a good marketing for marketing . ''
and i 'm going to give you a big expedition .
sounds crazy . but it 's coming back to the own imagination that makes a reality .
we created a lot of months later , in a particular , in fact , in a russian school , four miles of the north atlantic , and the real titanic was a <unk> of a <unk> .
this was not a movie , no , that was real .
so , that 's really the way i really did .
and the whole thing was , we had to have cameras and we had cameras and we have to make it all kinds of things .
and i noticed that , as much of this , i 've been working on a <unk> .
well , they were also working in the same , and we 've been planning to be planning .
you 're going to go into this capsule , then you 're in these dark , <unk> environment , where no hope is not going to make it even more back .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just as i was in a <unk> .
that 's really cool . ''
i was obsessed with the deep sea of the deep sea .
anyway , the part of curiosity and science . it was everything . it was it . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i could n't have to do .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that could make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i could see outside the outside .
and in some of the last few years , i 've seen things in the past , and sometimes things that i never saw before , sometimes , sometimes , that nobody had seen before the science and the science was when we saw them , but they were
so that 's really what i really wanted to be really interested , and i wanted to be more .
and so i met a little decision .
after the success of the titanic , i said , `` okay , i want to be my <unk> to hollywood in hollywood and it 's going to be a while . ''
and then we started to go to the <unk> , and they were working with it .
we went to the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which is a <unk> .
our intent was , and the <unk> of the ship was never done before .
nobody had ever ever been able to <unk> the inner <unk> of the <unk> . they had n't have a tool for that . so we developed the technology .
and so i 'm sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see that the same thing that you 've got to see is the <unk> of the <unk> , and i know that the band played a little bit .
and i fly with a little bit of the <unk> of the ship .
i 'm going to just be just but my consciousness is in the car .
it felt like i was physically in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the most important form of one of the most i ever ever ever ever ever have before , because before i had a corner of the <unk> , i knew what was the same time in the car , because i was months after the film was
so the <unk> was a very accurate copy of the <unk> of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
and they made me that that i realized that they need to be able to use this little avatars and use consciousness in the vehicle , in the other form of existence .
it was really very profound .
and perhaps a little bit of what might happen in some decades , if you have to have to explore something to explore or other things , in all of the different things that i can have to be able to do .
after this project we started seeing that we 've seen the first thing , to learn to learn that for example , we 've seen these incredible amazing animals that are like , but here 's the <unk> .
they live with the help of <unk> .
they 're not in a <unk> of the system , how we do this .
and so you see , you can see the right , the right , you can see the <unk> of a 500 degrees centigrade that you can survive .
and the same time i was interested in the same time , i was really interested in the first time of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and the <unk> and the <unk> and the right , and the right , and they 're going to go to the <unk> , and they 're going to go to the <unk> of the <unk>
that was fascinating .
but the end of it is that i was going to put it in the deep sea .
i took them to and you have to access the world , and for the world , , for people , who were interested in these extreme situations , i took them to the sources of them , and they can take them and test them and
we were in the world , but we actually have science , but in fact , more , more , more .
so the circle of my existence as a child , as a child , and the reality is the reality .
in the way that i 've learned a lot of knowledge .
i 've been a lot of science , but i think you can have a director , but you can have a <unk> , a leader , or so , like a <unk> .
i do n't understand it , but i do n't know what i 've been doing with this .
because i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what does it come ? ''
these stinking movies do n't make a money .
we 're just going to do the production of the <unk> , not a trail .
all think i think it was `` titanic '' and `` avatar '' and i had to put it on the <unk> on a towel on a towel .
i 've got all these films , this is a very small audience .
no <unk> , no no , no money , what do you do ?
you 're going to make it to the challenge , and the ocean is the most important environment that are there , and it 's the <unk> of the <unk> , and because of the strange connection , it 's a little group of people who are a team
because we 've got all these only 10 people to have been done for the years of <unk> , and we were two months to the <unk> in the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have to have a task , because you have a task that you ca n't have to tell you .
if you go to the country , and you say , `` we need to do it , the <unk> , and the whole thing , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human quality , you can do it , you can not do it in
there is a connection that gives you a certain respect .
so when i came back to my next film , i try to make the same thing , which is that you have to be able to be able to give you the team and <unk> their own <unk> .
and it was really changed .
so , so i was so with a little team on this , we were building the avatar with a new technology that was n't there .
it 's very exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were for a period of four years , and a family .
and it changed my way to make films , completely .
there was people who said , we 'd have to be able to have this idea , and we have to be on the planet .
for me , it was more important to do my job , which is the actual process that changed the result .
so what can we do from all of the close ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think it 's the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can create a reality .
and the idea of their team is more important than all of the world .
and i come to a <unk> <unk> , `` give me a advice that i can do . ''
and i say , `` do n't you even have a <unk> .
the <unk> you do n't do for you . do n't even remember yourself , not even yourself , but take risks . ''
nasa has to be a <unk> , `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the way , we have to be an alternative , because there 's a kind of <unk> .
not a very important innovation that innovation was , which was not a risk of risk .
you need to be willing to take these risks .
this is the idea that i want to give you to the way to be a <unk> , but it 's an alternative , fear , not . thank you .
today , i 'm talking about energy and climate .
and that may be surprising , because my <unk> is to reduce the foundation of <unk> and seed , and the things that we create , and we need to give the poorest two billion dollars .
but energy and climate matter is extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
and that means that their spending is not going to be more efficient , and it 's too much better , and it 's going to be much better than it 's not going to change their environment .
it 's going to be a <unk> . it leads to uncertainty .
so , it 's a change , it 's going to be a big <unk> .
and also , the most important thing is that it 's important for you .
fact , if you just get out of one thing , it 's the price of the price , it 's more likely to be the most effective .
now , the idea is about the time .
actually , it 's actually the norm .
the <unk> of the industrial revolution in the 20th century , and it was a <unk> case in the case , and we have <unk> <unk> , <unk> materials , we can make modern materials and so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let 's take the price of the price -- we 're going to put a new barrier and this barrier is on carbon .
co2 is the planet and the equation for co2 is quite clear .
they have to reduce the <unk> co2 , which is to be the <unk> and this , and that has a lot of negative effects , the weather effects , and perhaps worse , that 's the natural impact that the natural ecosystems can do n't change and so
now , the same relationship between between and the <unk> and the other and the other signs are there , there are some of them , but not many of them .
and there 's certainly a <unk> that 's bad , but they 're extremely bad .
i 've got the more question , `` we need to get to get down to zero ?
do n't have half of the half or a quarter of the <unk> ? ''
the answer is : until we 're near zero , we 'll get the temperature down .
so this is a big challenge .
it 's very different than we 're going to say , we have a <unk> <unk> high truck , which is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and you can get it out of the <unk> .
this is to be down to the bottom , zero .
now , we 're going to put a lot of a lot of carbon , and we 're talking about 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons of people , people like a lot of people , less than a .
in average , it 's about five tons of every planet .
and somehow we have to change changes that 's going to zero down .
it 's been far more <unk> .
only different economic changes , and we need to increase it to increase in the growth of increase and increase in zero .
this equation is four factors . a little bit of <unk> , and you have this thing -- the <unk> -- that you 're going to go to zero , and that 's the number of people who are dependent on the average of the world , which is
so let 's take a look at the same time , and we think we 're going to get to zero .
probably , you probably have to get a very close number of zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let 's go through it .
first we have the population .
today , we are 6.8 billion people .
and it 's going to be nine billion dollars to go on nine billion .
if we 're very successful with new <unk> , and we can be able to be able to get 10 percent of the year , but we 're going to see a slope of the time .
the second factor is the services we use .
that 's all the food that we eat , clothing , clothing , <unk> .
and that 's very good things and more , and that means that these products are almost almost to make any planet on the planet .
it 's great that this number is going to be .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could take it , and less , but the average number of the year is going to be more than the number of the year , and more than the number of the cost of the person .
here we see a very fundamental service of the home , and you can have the homework reading you can read ?
and these students do n't have to go , and they 're going to read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , the energy , the e , the energy is a service , there 's good news .
we have something that 's not going to be happening .
because of the whole successes , in the past , by other , , by the other , , by new ways , there are lots of services , which is a lot of services , which is spending more money to reduce 90 percent of them .
in other ways , how much of the manufacturing is , we 've been working on the <unk> , and the more competitive , or the quality of the <unk> , it 's a lot of <unk> , and it 's a lot of <unk> .
and if we 're optimistic , we 're going to be a factor of an increase or maybe a factor of a factor .
but in the first three factors , we 're now now 26 billion dollars on the planet , and it 's not just that easy .
so let 's see the fourth factor -- and this will be a be -- that 's the amount of co2 that 's going to be a <unk> unit .
it turns out that you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every single amount of energy , we 're going to reduce co2 , but the renewables and i 'm going to do it .
so what we 're doing on a global level is to create a new system .
we need to need .
now , if i ask the term `` wonders '' , i do n't mean the impossible .
the <unk> is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
people have to have the development of these miracles .
usually , there 's no <unk> that you have to get a miracle of a certain date .
usually , you 're just going to get out of the way , and some of them are not going to be a little bit .
in this case , we need to be <unk> and a miracle of a very short time .
well , i wondered how i can really do that ?
there 's a natural way , a demonstration of the idea that people are going to do this ?
i remembered me last year , when i had mosquitos and somehow liked people .
the idea was , you know , it 's really , you know , people are there , that people are living with mosquitos .
for energy , i was this one .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
so here 's a few natural fireflies .
you have told me that they 're not <unk> . they 're not going to leave the glass of the glass .
now , there 's all kinds of all of the same , but they do n't have all a lot of them .
we need solutions , either or a half of a tremendous scale and tremendous <unk> , and even though there 's many directions that people can see , and i can see that the big market can afford to afford that big .
i have to have <unk> , and we have <unk> <unk> .
and that may be a little bit of <unk> and if you do better than i expect , but my favorite line is that we 've got to have all of these five jobs , and we ca n't give them to give them because they have a lot
let 's look at the burning fossil fuels , which is burning of coal or natural gas .
what you do is it might be , but it 's not it , you need to get the co2 that you get from the <unk> , which is <unk> , and then you go and hope and hope that it 's going to be there .
there 's some <unk> that that 's going to be 60 percent of 80 percent , but it 's going to be a big challenge , but it 's going to be difficult to be difficult to get a lot of carbon , and a lot of the carbon
who will make it safe ?
who can do something that 's literally a lot of billion times more than any kind of garbage , you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough <unk> .
next : i 'm going to be a little bit .
the three big problems . the cost of all , in the countries , the question is , the question is that you can really feel that it 's not going to be wrong , even though the human rights will be used for weapons .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because although he 's not very big , there 's a lot of opinion .
so three very difficult problems that might be more <unk> , and that 's what you should work .
the last three of the five years i 've been .
it 's renewables as they 're often called it .
and also , even though it 's great , it 's not a fuel -- they have a little bit of <unk> .
for a <unk> , the energy that these technologies are dramatically greater than the <unk> .
that 's the first time you talk about many times more than a normal power .
and also , they 're also working on these sources .
the sun does n't seem to all day , but it does n't seem to be any day and the same , not the wind .
so , you have to be able to get out of these sources , and then you have a way of energy , if you 're not available to it .
so there 's a big deal . there 's challenges in the workforce , if we say that the energy is outside of the country , not only the technology , you need to have the energy that 's going to be from the energy from the
and there 's the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i 've been all kinds of batteries that are made , and that 's the same , the cars , computers , computer , , for everything , and that 's the amount of energy that we 've done , and that 's
so we need a big breakthrough , something that will be a factor of a factor , as a result of time .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not easy .
that happens when you try to get this more sources of data , 20 percent of the rest of the car .
if you 're going to take 100 percent of the world , you need an incredible amount of <unk> .
now where we 're going to go to , what is the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is many companies who are working on .
in every five areas , we need to be 100 people .
and you 're going to tell you , `` the are crazy ! it 's good .
i think there 's a lot of people in the ted group there are many people .
bill big has several companies , which is a <unk> , which has been the great <unk> .
and in fact , more private companies have been doing the great things and interesting opportunities and i try to support them .
nathan <unk> and i 'm going to build a company , which might be surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the development industry has been in this industry , so it 's not a big surprise , that some good concepts are lying on the front of the time .
that means that you 're going to be a part of the planet , which is a percent of the <unk> , which is the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent of the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but actually , you 've been thinking about it , but you could never have it to be able to do it , but it 's been modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you see that , yeah , yeah , it 's really that it
and because you 're going to reduce this 99 percent , it 's really much better .
actually , you can use the waste , and you can even use the waste of the oil as it 's as much as the <unk> .
instead of the head , it 's just it . it 's a great thing .
it 's going to be a <unk> , a little bit like a candle .
you see that it 's a kind of <unk> , often as the <unk> wave of string .
that 's the real thing that 's really true .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste of the 99 percent , you 've got the part of the <unk> , so it 's going to be more enriched uranium .
the u.s. is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you 're going to be successful , and just , you get enough to get the rest of the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's a example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to go to .
we think we should measure our success .
how should we look at our goals ?
now , we go to the goal that we need to get to the goal , and we 're talking about the <unk> .
many of them are about 80 percent of 2050 .
it 's really important to get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be in poor countries , and still still , and still , will be a <unk> , and ultimately , to be clean .
so , to get these 80 percent of the world , including the world , including china , , as china , their own <unk> .
the other note is , if we 're using the level of technology , if they 're in all of the world , we 're going to be able to get the way to get the rest of them .
this is great important .
this is a <unk> of this .
if we go out of the way , how would we be going to look at the 2020 ?
it would be the two elements of the two elements .
we should use the best price to be able to get to the way we get the more , and the less we need to be the temperature of the temperature and the temperature .
but actually , this note for the things that we do n't have to have the biggest <unk> , but even more importantly , or even something like the other ones that the <unk> of innovation is the innovation of innovation .
so this breakthroughs to be with the <unk> , and we can measure it , in the case , in the private election , and it 's more important .
there 's many great books to this topic .
al gore said `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> , `` the <unk> of the air air air . ''
they 're going to be able to make it through a <unk> that can be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the whole <unk> of all pages .
there 's some things that come together .
this is a wish .
a very much wish that we 're doing this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i would have to choose the president , a <unk> , and i love that wish , or i wish that 's the desire to be <unk> , because it 's not going to be a
this is the biggest impact .
if we do n't get this desire , we will get the <unk> between the long and not <unk> people in the united states , and china is between the united states and the poor countries , and almost all of the life , and almost every life will
so what do we do ?
for what i do ?
we need to use more <unk> for us .
if countries are in places like their , they do n't want to talk about co2 .
they should be able to talk to this , and they would be a little bit of the ridiculous things that we 've been doing for these innovative ideas .
we need to need more co2 , and we need to add the consumer trade , which is a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we need to get to a lot of and <unk> and the things that we 've been doing .
it 's a more important desire , but i think we can do it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you . just to get better , and you can be able to understand a idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : the simulation of a supercomputer to do all the great scientists , what we 've done , we need to do some 10 million years , and even if we have our materials in a russian software , we have to make sure that it works
the difficult step is to build the first step of the first , another billion , and the place of the first one of the first one of the first time .
once the first time , when he 's going to be as well as i promised , it 's all obvious , because the economic crisis is as much as a little bit of the time we know .
to understand that , that means that the <unk> is going to build a vertical <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , that 's the process of the process , and then the process goes down to the bottom , and then it goes down to the
bg : right . so you have to get the reactor in the <unk> , so there 's lots of people and lots of things that can go back . this thing is going to go up and get things . it 's not good .
if you 're very cheap fuel , you can get it for 60 years -- you think -- you 're <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and it 's going to be done , and it 's done .
a nuclear reactor is a solution for the waste .
bg : yeah . now , what 's going to do with the garbage , you can go there -- there 's lots of less waste of this technique -- then you take it and put it into the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the garbage , which is that it 's already in the same , and it 's all the time that 's going to be the <unk> .
so what 's that that was that this meant that this is a problem that we 're going to put in our <unk> and it 's going to be dramatically more dramatic than this process .
but while you 're talking about different people that are talking about this world .
where is the biggest interest in what really do ?
bg : well , we do n't have a place that 's a place , and there 's a lot of interesting things for all the <unk> , there 's a lot of interest , and the people who were in russia , and the people who were in
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is an alternative one that was done .
this is a more important step , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries that have built this , so that 's a very fast reactor , which is a <unk> for our first .
in your idea , it 's time , and probability , and that 's what 's going to be a real life ?
bg : well , we need to be a <unk> of this , which is very cheap , and we 've got to be 20 years to make the <unk> and 20 years .
this is the <unk> that we 've got to have the <unk> of the <unk> we need to do .
and you know , if everything is good , and it 's a great wish , it might be easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of people who are working in the way that they work for their work , for the future .
and it would be the best if you can make multiple , because then you could take a mixture of it .
we need a solution .
and the great breakthroughs of breakthroughs , this is the largest thing that you know ?
bg : a more <unk> is the most important .
it would n't be the same , but it 's still more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we know how to do this , but it 's the <unk> way that it 's a different approach .
there 's a <unk> , which is something that seems to be difficult , but maybe it 's going to tell us that it 's about us .
and so there 's different , but the beautiful thing is that a grant has a million times more much than a lot of energy , and that 's a more important thing , and that 's why you can solve problems and the problem , and the amount
if it does n't work , what then ?
we need to be able to do it to try to be able to make the <unk> stable ?
bg : if you think in this situation , it 's like you have a lot of food , and you 're going to be a heart attack , what does you do ? you need a <unk> or something like that .
there 's a more important consumer <unk> , which is to take different techniques to change the climate , which we have 20 or 30 years to be on the same time .
that 's just a <unk> .
you hope that we need to do that .
some people say , you should n't just do that for the insurance work , because you can make sure that you eat , because you know that it 's going to be a <unk> .
i do n't know if it 's smart , if you think the importance of this problem , but there 's a <unk> in the moment that if you have to be able to be able to get the things that we 're going to get , or that
climate change : you have a or two sentences for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the data is in very different <unk> .
those who are doing the scientific arguments , are very little .
say , there are negative effects that are going to do the clouds , which is the things that we do ?
there are very few things that you can say , which is a chance of a million .
that 's how to do this as aids .
you do n't make the mistakes , and you pay a lot of time .
and so that 's the idea , if you all have all kinds of solutions , in something that you 've been going to be discovered , and that 's not that the investment is not really clear , but it 's not the <unk> of the world ,
the fact that this uncertainty is concerned .
but my dream is that if you can make it , and the same thing , the co2 , you say , `` okay , '' that 's not the skeptics , `` okay , it does n't mean that it 's not a co2 , but i 'll
and that would be the answer to the argument that if you all take this time and energy energy , the problem of the problem , all the other targets , the value of the <unk> , and that 's the idea that we can do , and that
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- say , the u.s. government is 10 billion dollars more than you do today -- that 's not dramatically .
and there 's no other things that 's not suffering .
you get to be a big , and there can be a lot of people who do n't have to do that , and it 's not that it 's going to be a way that 's going to be the most important .
it 's because it 's very short to be a little bit of <unk> , and they just want to be the way that we think we should have more things that have the potential to be much less cheaper .
if you get the first , you get a very high quality , and then you can just keep the rich .
i mean , everyone 's going to be five times more than much better than our energy to change their lifestyle .
for the lower two billion , it 's a disaster .
and even of course , it 's about .
his new job is , `` why do n't we have to do the research ? ''
he will still be still because of his former stories , but he realized that this is a very rare group , and so he 's going to be the <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that i think .
the research is just crazy , how much the <unk> will be .
bill , i think i 'm going to talk to everybody , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to tell you that you 're going to be true , thank you . thank you .
bg : thank you .
so , a few years ago , ted , peter <unk> , `` the <unk> <unk> . ''
the idea is pretty simple , the largest <unk> <unk> , the same <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on .
and even though it really seems really easy , it 's really hard because it 's really hard to work .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i 've been able to get it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since i 've been talking about 70 workshops in the world , students , and architects , even at the same time , and there 's something that 's going to be a little bit of the interaction of the collaboration and i want to share some of them
usually , most people are trying to do themselves .
you talk about what you 're looking at , it 's going to be a <unk> of power .
then they invest a little time in planning and organization . and it 's <unk> .
they invest in a lot of their time in the way they 're doing the same structures .
and finally , until you have no time , you have a little bit of the marshmallow and you put it down to the top , and you 'll get a step back , and they 're going to be <unk> .
but what 's happening , it 's always that that means that `` the consumer '' is `` <unk> '' because the weight of the <unk> is that the whole thing is going to be the whole thing .
there are a series of people who have more more than more than others , and under the worst of the worst , <unk> .
they lie , they 're often , they 're confused and they 're really interested in the same .
and of course , there 's also a lot of more more than the <unk> , and the best ones are <unk> in the best <unk> of the <unk> .
and this is pretty amazing .
how did we do the <unk> , they do n't just have the biggest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all of all .
what might you be wondering ? how does this ? why ? what is that ?
and peter said , `` no children are going to be a child in the head of the <unk> . ''
they do n't invest in the time .
there 's another reason .
and that 's what <unk> trained <unk> to find the right plan , ok !
and it 's going to be true .
what happens when you get the marshmallow on the top , they have no time and what happened ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar ?
what do you do is that they 're going to start with the marshmallow and prototypes , and we built a lot of <unk> , the marshmallow , the the the the way they had the <unk> to make the <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> of the kind of collaboration is the kind of <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and with each other , you get the kids , and what does n't work .
so this is the performance of working with prototypes , but we see how different teams are .
the average number of most of us is about the average , <unk> , <unk> , the amount of lawyers , but not much more , and more than adults , are better than adults .
who 's the most successful ?
architects and engineers , happiness .
<unk> is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they 're triangles and more <unk> patterns of the key structures to build a structure .
<unk> is something about average . but here 's interesting .
you can be a <unk> in the team , you 're going to be more better .
it 's incredible . you see , and you see this team . ''
you can predict the predictions why ?
because they have special skills .
they 're going to understand the process that they understand .
and this team that regulates it and work is the work of the team of the team .
and the ability to have and and their ability to achieve their combination .
if you have 10 teams , you have the <unk> , you get , you have to get the stable structures .
i tried to make something fascinating .
i thought we 'd have to be the same thing .
so i was a $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ a $ $ $ $ 50,000 dollars .
what do you think about this ?
what was the result ?
this is not a team , a team of a robust structure .
if anyone had a high school , he had to be able to get the price of home .
so it 's not interesting that high effort have a strong effect ?
we 're using this exercise with the same students .
what do you think ?
now , they did the advantage of the war .
so , the same thing , the same team of the best .
they 're the highest construction in the time .
so there 's so important lessons for us to think about nature and success .
you might ask , why would you make a more time in a common world ?
the reason is , i use digital tools and processes to help them , and more , and more , and more <unk> , and `` <unk> . ''
and what 's the best thing is to find them to identify the hidden assumptions .
because open , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language , and the <unk> to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience that this simple exercise .
and those of them who are interested in ,
it 's a blog where you see the <unk> .
there 's a <unk> there .
they 're just crazy examples of all the world , like people and <unk> .
there 's also a lot of time .
and the lesson i think is that the process is actually a <unk> sports .
it 's that we need to make our sense of the task , and we 're going to use our own approach to our feelings , and our feelings that we 're facing .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience , what it needs to be to be a <unk> `` <unk> '' to be a moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we do n't have a machine that we have to do .
a big machine , a cool machine , and this is a time .
and everybody in this room has to be in this room .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future , you ca n't go in here .
and i ask what you would choose , because i had my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go back to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back to the time before they were or twitter or twitter , or america 's <unk> .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you 're kind of thinking about <unk> , thinking about this .
and i understand .
i 'm not part of this group , i need to say .
i do n't want to go in the past , and that 's because i 'm a <unk> <unk> .
it 's because that 's not going to go back to this planet , you go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most important time that ever ever existed on this planet , no matter what it 's : health , health , mobility , regulation , declining .
there was never before this time .
my <unk> died of all of the time was 60 .
my grandparents are on the number of 70 .
my parents are the 80 of the <unk> .
so , so , i should be better at the beginning of my first time .
but it 's not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that is going to be in new york , and so as long as the richest man , the world was a year in the world .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox smallpox smallpox , smallpox has been killed in this planet .
you have the demographics of earth in a way , which is not a war .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we have to be <unk> .
in the rich world , there are diseases of us , the millions of us just have a generation of a generation , not even yet .
and , , , , , , , .
anybody else does that ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed people , who are the successes of the science .
and from my view , the scientific method is trying to figure out whether it works , if it does n't work , it 's not a great achievement of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , it 's the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they were often afraid .
and one of that is that despite all of our achievements of our achievements of people in this world every day , to go to bed .
these number goes , and they 're very fast , and it 's embarrassing .
and not only that we have our imagination to make this world .
drinking water , the country , rainforests , oil , it 's going to be , and then we 're not going to eat that chaos , we also have to go .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can produce food , people can feed the billions of people , without the country , to make them .
i think we can use this world with energy that they did n't even have .
i think that 's really , and no , that 's not an wishful game .
but this is the night at night -- one of the things that i lie at night , we 've never been doing science so much that we never have to do it .
and we were never able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it as well as we can .
we 're at the cusp of the amazing events , amazing events in many places , and yet i think that we 've got hundreds of years to go back to the world , and we have to find a time that we 've been going to have to
people are <unk> in their faith , and so that 's so that you ca n't be able to get it .
not the truth will be free .
and listen , everyone has a right thing to be right , even right now , right now , right now ,
but you know what they do n't have right ?
they have n't really have their own facts . they do n't have to be .
and i 've got a while to figure out that .
now , about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about <unk> <unk> in the new yorker , a little paper .
and i was amazed to be on the resistance , and on the end of the most important health in health in the history of mankind .
i did n't know what i should do , i did n't just know what i wrote , and i wrote a paper and went on .
and soon , i wrote a paper about <unk> food .
the same thing is just bigger .
people were crazy .
so i wrote it on a paper , and i could n't understand why people thought that it would be , `` well , '' why they believed that molecules were a random kind of a random way to be a <unk> of the nature of nature .
but you know what i do . i wrote the paper , i made it .
i mean , i 'm journalist .
we 're going to do that , we 're going to eat food , we 're okay .
but this article made me , and i could n't figure out why , and then i found it out .
and that 's that that 's that that 's all the time that i did n't have to have any interest .
these were <unk> people , educated people , people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that was what i found .
but then i thought , what we 're going to be honest .
we 're at a point that we 're not going to have the same relationship for progress .
we 're talking about it .
we 're talking about it , with little <unk> , `` progress . ''
okay , there 's reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science , there 's no reason why that should not be .
you can just give a couple of names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the 2000 2000 .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people who believed that they were pretty well , so they were skeptical .
ask you , ask , you have evidence , for example .
take it out .
but now , if you get evidence , you have to take evidence of evidence , and we 're not good .
and i can say that that 's the reason that we 're going to be in an epidemic of the fear of the <unk> , how never never seen , and hopefully never will happen .
over 12 years ago , a story published , a horrible story that the <unk> has to be with the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
many studies were looking at this , if it was .
many studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came out in the united states , from england , from <unk> , and they were all the same , no connection , no connection .
it does n't make difference . it does n't matter because we believe we believe we believe what we see , what we see is what we 're really comfortable .
we do n't think about a <unk> documents of a <unk> , which is , and i understand that , i think that we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was devastating .
and so , as a result of this , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world that 's <unk> with <unk> .
this is a massive and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what 's happening that we could do .
well , i understand that .
because there 's somebody else ?
one single one of the audience can die in the audience ?
not often .
in this country , not , but <unk> in the world , the last year .
that 's many deaths by <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can do it , and people like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and illiteracy of drones like <unk> and larry king .
and that can make it because they 're not connecting and ties .
they do n't understand that these things seem to be true , but almost never the same .
and that 's something that we learn to learn , and it 's very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas .
he <unk> us from one of the worst of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the guy in the middle of the middle .
he 's called paul <unk> .
he has just been a few other people to participate .
he can save the life of the world , 500,000 children per year in the world .
pretty well , not ?
well , this is good , except that paul <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and how valuable they are , and people should stop .
and that 's what he says .
so paul is a <unk> .
if paul <unk> in a public talk , he ca n't talk to him .
he gets to get <unk> to the people , because people want to tell you what they 're going to do with school .
and why ? because paul did have a <unk> .
i do n't need to say , but vaccines are essential .
you take them , you 're going to go back , <unk> , terrible diseases , and that 's happening .
we have to have a country .
and that 's worse , and pretty soon , you 'll die , because it 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just going to die by <unk> .
what is we ? do we do this ? why do n't we do this ?
one of me was a couple of weeks ago , and i told me a little bit about a little bit .
nobody has ever been told .
they would n't have to be <unk> . they do n't have to <unk> .
<unk> .
why ? because we do n't have a <unk> , and you know what ?
we had n't seen this country .
today , i do n't know , maybe in the morning , in a plane , and in a plane , you go to los angeles , in the moment , he 's about ohio .
and in a few hours , he 's going to be a car , and he 's going to go to long beach , and he will be a little bit of this staff .
and he does n't know that he 's with a <unk> disease , and we do n't know that because it works .
this is the planet we live on . not as if he does n't .
we love it to lie . we love that .
now , you have to have your vitamins ?
and so , a little bit of that , you can get it on the ground .
i know that they 've done that because half of the americans are going to make the day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it does n't make a difference , how often we find that they are useless .
the data is that the data is happening .
they 're going to be <unk> their urine . they never never have .
this is okay , you want to be <unk> billion billion dollars in the dark .
i 'm going to tell you a lot of them .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i think we hate the industry .
we hate a strong government . we have no confidence in the system .
and that should n't be our health system . our health is not .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and even more even to afford that .
so we 're going to go away and where we 're going to go away ?
we 're going to run the poor in the poor .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know that it 's really serious , because it 's crap , and we 're going to give billions dollars .
and i 've got all kinds of little <unk> <unk> .
none of them -- it 's been , , , , , , , , , , i do n't know what it 's , but we 're going to give billions dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i say that , people say , `` what do you do ? let 's do you what ? ''
so they feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it 's not true , whether it 's the secretary of law , says , `` hmm , i 'm going to give you the evidence of my experts not to do the same , or some of the patients who want to be treated with their patients
if you go to this way , where i think and magic and magic are also going to be a place where you 're not going to be .
they 're going to be in the south africa .
he brought 400,000 people to say because he was paying up that the red , and more importantly , more effective than they 're going to know that we can know that we can take the operation of aids .
hundreds of <unk> deaths in a country , which is worse than any other of this disease .
do n't tell me that these things are not consequences .
they have them . they 've always been .
now , the <unk> epidemic in the field we 're just here is that this is the ridiculous struggle between the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
this is a more controversial debate . you have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single , every <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no interest .
there was no christmas . we 've done everything .
we 've done it in the last 50 years .
and some of them has been working and some of them .
we 're not <unk> what it does .
now we can do it in a lot of time , and of course , there 's risks , but we can do something like vitamin d , and that 's the stuff that can help millions people to help millions of people .
do n't you do it ?
i have to say , i do n't understand .
we 're <unk> food , food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i 'm hearing is , many chemicals , pesticides , pesticides , , we do n't want to be huge fields with one thing that 's wrong .
we do n't want to make companies live .
we do n't want to have companies .
and you know what my answer is , what is this ?
yes , they 're right . we do that .
it 's true , we have a huge amount of science , but this is not science .
that 's not science to do science .
it 's right , moral , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not a idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it does n't work , but the idea that we do n't want to allow science to do the science , because we 're afraid of it , and it 's a real end of people , and it 's about people
you know , in the next 50 years , we 'll have 70 percent more food than the moment in the moment .
this investment in africa in africa in africa .
embarrassing .
they need that , and we do n't give them .
and why ? <unk> changed .
we do n't want to encourage people to encourage this to be more <unk> , like for example .
and it 's something that 's a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's not <unk> .
it has no nutrients , it 's not a protein , and scientists just build all this time .
and then people could eat the food and would n't be blind .
they would n't be hungry , and you know what ?
it would be nice . it would n't be more , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i say , `` why do we do that ?
i mean , ask , why do we do that ?
because we do n't want to have any genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our value , better food , better food , it 's not food .
it 's not about it , it 's about it , it 's about people , and it 's going to be the time to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do that , we do n't have to do something about something that we think , not guilty , like , <unk> , <unk> .
there 's no other description for what 's happening here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not <unk> , and we need to be able to do that .
so , this incredibly funny conversation , you want to say , `` you want to be still going to be a ridiculous time and go into the future ? ''
in every case , i want to be in every case .
in the moment , you have a incredible possibility .
we can use this time to all of the way we want .
we can get them into where we want to be in the way we want to be going to be going to go to where we want to be .
we have to have these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go into the time and we 're going to be happy to be happy .
i know that we can be able to see it , and it 's what 's going to be the world that 's going to do .
thank you .
thank you .
since i 'm interested in a lot of time , i think it seems like a magician , it 's a magician , because it 's like , as a deception , that 's a kind of <unk> that 's going to be a little bit more important .
with other words , in some studies , a <unk> impact , that is the best , and it 's just because the person thinks that you 're going to be a <unk> or a kind of <unk> -- in the fact , that 's the only thing that
a deception is something that 's really important .
so we can understand each other , i want to show you a basic simple trick .
and i 'll show you how he works . this is a trick that 's at least the 1950s in every year for children .
i 've been able to have it from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the 1970s .
i 'll give him it to go to it and it 's going to explain it .
and then i 'm going to explain why i 'm going to explain it .
so , what happens .
the knife that they can study , and my hand can be able to study them .
i 'm going to get the knife just in my own .
i 'm going to give my <unk> back .
and to make sure that nothing is in my <unk> , or it 's coming out , i 'm going to just get my wrist on this .
and you can see that it 's not a time that 's going to be a little bit of time , and i can do it in my sleeve , or it 's going to be a little bit of it .
and the goal is just simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything is going to be <unk> , the knife through my own <unk> <unk> .
it 's actually in the place that i can shake it , without the knife .
nothing goes into my shirt or come out , and they can all have .
and it 's true .
now , this is a trick that i 'm often often taught to be optimistic for magic , because you can learn much more much about deception , when you look at a very simple trick .
probably many of you here in the room .
he works .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i 'm going to tell my wrist to make sure that nothing is wrong in my sleeve , or it 's a lie .
the reason why i 'm going to have my wrist to be the key secret that the illusion is .
in the moment , where i 'm going to get my hand from you , you 're going to see the back of the back , and then you see this finger , my favorite <unk> , where he was , where he was in a position that 's
great trick ?
there 's no childhood , who had no childhood .
so , he 's here .
and when i 'm going to get to the future , the finger is going to be the place .
and now you can talk about why it 's a deception , why you ca n't see that there 's only three fingers , because the mind and the way that it does n't matter , you 're not just talking about , , two , three ,
but it 's not now , and then i open my hand .
and of course , it 's not going to be <unk> , but not by the <unk> of my body , but by a trick , it 's going to be a little bit of my favorite ones .
and if i 'm my hand , i 'll get the same thing to be through , because i 'm going to get through this movement that 's going to be the <unk> of the fingers .
i take this hand . and here 's the knife .
this trick can be your friends and neighbors .
now what did that do with the job ?
so , i was a year , and i read a study that i really was really really interested .
i 'm not a doctor or researchers , and so that was why i was a amazing thing .
it turns out that it 's what you 're looking at , if you put a <unk> in a white ball , it 's a <unk> , you 're just a <unk> , white pill , the <unk> of the <unk> .
but if you look at the shape that you 're going to get in the case , you 're going to see a smaller ball , and these blue and a letter , you can actually be able to be able to be able to be able to be
and that 's not even any of these <unk> , it 's just the same .
but a white pill is not so good as a blue ball .
what did it really get me wrong .
it turns out that it 's not all it .
if you 're <unk> , they 're more than a <unk> form of each other .
a colored capsule that was at a end of yellow and the other red is , it 's better than a white capsule .
and also the idea is a role .
a pill twice as much as three pills -- i ca n't remember the same statistics . i 'm sorry .
but the key is , ...
and that 's also the <unk> of a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate security , you need to get your needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> , a few of a sudden , a little bit of a <unk> , which is a patient .
this is a very strong picture in the head , which is very much more than a white ball .
this chart is really -- i 'll tell you another time when we have a <unk> .
so , the white pill is n't so much like the blue pill , not so much as a capsule that does n't seem like the needle .
and none of it has actually been a <unk> property . it 's just our belief that we have a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i suppose that obviously , obviously , it 's a deception , and i 'll look at it .
we know , we know , the study of the study that you need to do , if you go to the point .
this is a 18 inches long . it 's very much , and i 'm going to show you a little bit of little <unk> .
this is really my meat . it 's not really <unk> , <unk> .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
i 'm going to put this needle in my skin and through them through the other side .
if you 're going to be bad -- if you 're just going to fall -- i 've been just a couple of friends in the room , and some people who did n't know , and i was a woman .
so i 'm going to ask you if you 're going to be fast , if you 're going to take the next 30 seconds , or you know , what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to take the first time to go back to
you can see it can be able to see it , but you can also be able to do it .
so , it 's like that , where my meat begins , the lower part of my presentation is just a little bit .
do i really know , do you make it crazy ?
and now , just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , it 's coming out .
now we 're in the same situation that we had to have .
it 's about .
but now you can do n't , you can not count , or ?
so , i 'm going to show you that one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think if you see this .
they say , `` okay , that 's not stupid , and the <unk> of the skin is just a few minutes . ''
well , i 'll show you what i 'm going to show you .
how does this look like this ? pretty well .
yeah , i know .
and the people back back to the `` okay . i did n't have seen this . ''
people in the future are going to be in the workforce .
let me show you what you 're going to show you .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can see the <unk> .
sorry . if you 're going to be bad , you look at it , you do n't look at it .
the people who are going to see the next time , and the time you see , `` well , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , but if it was real , it would be a hole , and it 's really if it was really ,
okay , let me take you a little blood for you .
yes , here 's it .
normally i would take the needle .
i would be my poor and you 're not going to show you that there 's no wounds .
but i think this is what i think of this , and with intention , to make a sense of a real difference , i 'm going to make the needle just in the way , and so the stage is going to go .
we 're going to be going to be a few days ago .
i hope you 're going to be very excited . thank you .
everybody talk about happiness .
i 've got some people who are the number of books , who are called `` <unk> '' in the last five years , and they were waiting to have been over 40 , and there was more much more .
there are a huge wave of interest in happiness .
there 's a lot of interest .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these <unk> , there are several cognitive biases that are almost impossible to do it , to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly of these cognitive <unk> .
this is true for the <unk> of your own happiness , and it 's also for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we 're exactly like all other other things .
the first one of this is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is not useful , because we 're doing it in many different things .
i think there 's a certain meaning that we can have to be able to be able to be , but in the big and all of the things that we need to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be
the second is a experience of experience and memory , which is actually being happy in his life and happy to be happy with his life .
and these are two different concepts , and they 're both more important to the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's the kind of fact that we ca n't think about a certain way to think of well-being without the well-being of its importance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive problem .
there 's just no way to get it .
now , i 'd like to start with a example of someone who had a <unk> one of my lectures , who was a story , he said , he said , he was a <unk> , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was a very
and then he 's really really emotional , which has the whole experience .
but that did n't have it .
what was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes to be <unk> .
she did n't mean because he was a memory , but the memory was , and the memory was everything that he had to get .
what we really say is that we 're talking about ourselves and other people might think about the way of two species of self .
there 's a more important self that 's in the present and the present is , but the present is , but the present is just the present .
it 's the primary self , who 's the physician 's <unk> , you know , when the doctor says , `` does it feel better , if i want to leave you ? ''
and then it 's a more important self , and that 's the idea that the story is , and the story of our life is , and it 's the physician that he asks the question , `` how did you feel about the last time ? ''
or how did you go to the journey ? '' or so , like it .
these are two different units , and the self itself and the self and the two , and the two is part of the most of the happiness of happiness .
now , the self is a storyteller .
and this starts really with a fundamental reaction on our memories -- it starts to go .
we do n't tell stories about us , when we 're doing stories .
our memory tells us stories that we 're going to have to be our own , is a story .
and let 's start with a example .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients that are a painful problem .
i 'm not going to go to the details . they 're not more painful , but they were painful , as the study was in the 1990s .
they were asked to be <unk> to the age of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're asked , `` who are you more <unk> ? ''
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has been clear . his more <unk> , and every minute , the patient had a patient , and more than it was .
but now there 's another question : `` how did you know that these patients were doing that ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient has a lot of more than the patient has to be a patient .
the stories of the most important , and because a very important part of history is how they end .
and no of this stories is very , very important , but one of them is that this is this .
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the worse , the worse , where the pain was at the end of his peak . it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we 've got these people to ask their job , and also , as bad , how bad was the whole thing ?
and she was much worse for a minute for the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the self and the self itself .
and from the point of the self , it 's a <unk> time .
now what you can do with patient , and we 've done experiments in experiments , and it 's done , and it 's actually actually the ability to make the patient just a <unk> of the <unk> , and it 's not to be a little bit of
that will be that the patient has ever been , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you have a couple of minutes , you have to be that that 's the ultimate self , and you have a little bit of the weight that has been a better person , because you have a better story about his experience .
what 's a story from this ?
and that 's the stories that makes us feel and it 's also important for the stories that we invent .
and what 's a story is , it 's just the most important moments , and then it 's going to be a lot of other moments .
end very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
now , the life has alive .
it 's just the most important thing to be one of the other .
and you ask , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're still lost .
i mean , most of our life -- and i 've been -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds , what means that you know that it 's going to live in a life about 600 million dollars . it 's about a month .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> .
and yet , you get the sense that you 're going to be aware of what 's happening in the most of the most important life .
it 's limited to the resource we use we 're on this world .
and how we use it , it 's not important , but that 's not the story that the self is going to be interested in us .
so we have the ability to be and the self , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the time with time .
from the moment of the self , if you have a vacation and the second week , the first week is the first , the first day , the next vacation ever went on the vacation vacation .
so this does n't work for the self .
for the moment , for the moment , you have a better vacation better than the next day , because there 's no new memories .
they have n't changed the story .
and in this way , it 's really important that the critical variable that has a value of self is a bit of a bit of a self , but it 's very much influence in this story .
now , the more important self is more than to remember and stories .
it 's actually the decisions that you 're going to be , because if you have a patient , we say , two two people who have been going to choose to be able to decide what he 's going to choose , and the <unk> is the <unk>
that 's not the <unk> of the election .
we do n't choose to choose between us , we 're going to choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we think we 're not going to do our future .
we think about our future as a more memory .
and basically , you can see that , you know , when a <unk> of security self , and you can think of yourself , as one of the self , that 's the <unk> self , the <unk> of the experience that does n't need to be .
i 've been able to tell you that if we 're going to make a lot of the case , we 're going to do that , we 're going to make a lot of <unk> , and we 're going to make the <unk> of the security system
and this is a little bit hard to do .
i mean , how do we do our memories ?
this is a explanations that has been the dominance of the value of the law .
and when i think about it , i think i 've been a couple of years ago in the 1930s , which was the best vacation ever had ever been , and i think i 'm going to think about a lot of people in the relationship , as
and i 've probably been able to have my memories to be on this journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever had the <unk> , i 've got to have the <unk> of the <unk> , i 've spent a couple of time .
now , these are three weeks , and that 's the same one for a hours .
there seems to be a battle .
well , i like a little bit of you , you know , how little <unk> <unk> i have , but even if you do more , you have a real question , why do we have to make memories more weight in the weight , which we 're
so i want to think about this thought .
imagine your next vacation , you know , that 's the end of the all of the <unk> you will be going to be <unk> and they 're going to get a drug that they 're not going to be aware of it .
now , you would have the same vacation ?
and if you have a other vacation , there 's a conflict between your two species and you have to think about how they do this conflict , and that 's not obvious because you 're going to think of the way you think of the way you think
why we 're doing the <unk> that we 're facing is a problem that we 're choosing with a choice between the two species .
now , the two species of the self are two of the happiness on the happiness .
there are two concepts of happiness that we can use , one of a one of a self .
so you can ask , how happy is that the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask , how are you happy to be the moments of the life of the self ?
and they 're all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be able to be able to do ?
and , by the way , we 're now pretty good to get the most good idea of happiness for the time of the time .
if you ask the happiness of the self , it 's a different thing .
that 's not what you 're happy to live .
it 's like , like , or <unk> person , if you think about your life .
very different .
everyone who do n't mean that these things are not different from happiness , and i 'm a lot of researchers about the study of happiness that are the most important of happiness in the way that we have the way that we have .
the distinction between happiness and happiness is the ultimate self in the past years , and now they have to be able to measure the two animals .
the <unk> of the world has been a global survey , which is more than a half million people who have been talking about their life and about their experiences and it was other efforts in the direction .
so in the past , we started to start with the happiness of the two species of themselves .
and the the lesson that we think , i think , is that they 're really different .
you can know how someone who 's living with his life , and that tells you what you do n't really know how happy life is life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation that is about the relationship is about .
what means that if you would meet someone , you would say , `` oh , dad is a bit more , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you would have something about his size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
they have a lot of uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody 's life is a number of 10 times a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty that 's like happy to be with his own self .
so the key is to be here .
we know something about the happiness of the election .
we know that money is very important , goals , very important .
we know that happiness is actually being happy with people who we like , to spend time to people we like .
there are other pleasure , but it 's also the <unk> .
so if you 're lucky to be the most of the two species of the self , they 're going to be very different to do the end of things .
the conclusion of what i said , i 'm not going to be able to be able to be a <unk> of well-being .
it 's a completely different term .
well , now , a other reason , that we ca n't think about happiness is that we 're not going to be on the same things when we think about life and we live in life .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they 're not going to answer the answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people are going to be in california , if you say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about the life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that 's what we say , we 're going to say , in climate climate .
well , it turns out that climate not really matter for the self , and it 's not even very important for the kind of thing that you 're trying to do as happy people .
but because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can be at the end of the end of the end of california .
and it 's kind of interesting to see what happens to people who are going to be going to be able to be happy to be happier .
now , you 're not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you 'll think that they 're happier because if you think about it , it 's like awful , the weather in ohio , and they 're feeling that they have the right decision .
it 's very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i 've been a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i 've got a question .
thank you .
now , when we have a couple of weeks ago , i 've been looking at this very interesting results that came from this year .
is that something that you can do with us , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we 've found in the survey has found a number of that we 've never been able to find .
we found that in the most successful self .
when we looked at the same , how feelings of the income .
and it turns out that there 's a income for 60,000 dollars in the year , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about <unk> , but it 's a big representative sample , which is a $ 100 percent of dollars in the year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are people are unhappy , and they 're increasingly less less than they 're going to be .
it 's a totally flat line .
i mean , i 've seen this flat lines .
what happens is that the money is not a shoe , but it 's not a <unk> of money , but we can do this misery very well , very carefully .
in the sense of the other self , you have to be a different story .
the more money you need to be the <unk> .
that 's not true for emotions .
but danny <unk> in the entire american effort is to live , freedom , freedom .
if people take these choices seriously , i would think it seems to be all the head , everything , what we think about , for example , in terms of terms of traffic and so forth .
there 's a chance that politicians would have to be a <unk> of the world , and that would be a question of how would be going to be able to do it ?
dk : you know , i believe that it 's important for the role of the state of politics .
the truth will be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , they 're just going to go in and in other countries .
people are in the way that they 're thinking , if you think about politics .
it will be a while , and people will be going to be able to be able to explore whether they want to be more important or whether they want to be able to be able to get to the discussion of this discussion .
how you can get lucky to be very different depending on how they think about it , or whether you think about the self , or if you think about the value of yourself , you think about the value of yourself .
that 's politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you have to measure the more of the population .
that 's what i think , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national world .
now , it seems to be this topic , or should be least the most important political debate for the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane <unk> . i love games .
i think i 've been able to make 10 years of <unk> , and my goal is to be able to make it easy to make the world in the world , as they save in the world .
i have a plan for that , i want to convince you , including you , and i want to spend more time to play more time and more playing games .
now we spend three billion hours per week .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole lot of time . ''
maybe a lot of time , if you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research research on the future of the future , which is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week , not to be far enough to solve the world .
in fact , i believe that if we 're going to be the next century to this planet , we have to be able to do this time .
i 've been suggesting that the time that the time was going to spend a lot of time in the 21st billion hours .
so that seems to be something that 's more important , so i can think it 's what we can do , if we 're problems , poverty , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , and we need to do that , we need to be
no , i mean , i mean , i really mean , i mean , i mean , i 'm really serious .
why ? this image is pretty precisely why i think that games are essential for the human species in the future .
this is a picture of the photographers .
he wanted to play the feelings of play . so he was a camera on the front of the camera .
this is a classic <unk> playing game .
if you do n't have a player , you might be some of the <unk> in this picture .
you see this sense of urgency , something , but also , very much , a lot of activity , in the problem , in the problem , a very difficult problem .
if you 're playing , you see some <unk> here , the top of the top , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrow show you .
this is a player that 's on the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know . okay . so we 've got some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that that 's very positive , that they did n't know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you 're there , they 're shocked to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little victory .
this player is a very <unk> victory .
and this is what we 're looking at in millions of <unk> in the world , if we have the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , the face of all the <unk> <unk> on the edge of the <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we 're difficult problems .
i call it as `` life '' is bad . and it 's actually my face , you know ? yes ? ok .
i 'm like i 'm going to do that in life , i 'm bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home , california where i was in my <unk> , as we 're in the real life , in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we 're not doing that in the reality of how we play .
and i do n't mean , even though , i 'm not going to be a good job .
we 're going to get more in the more important , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i 've got to do something with the motivation that 's doing something to do with the other things .
if we 're in a <unk> , i think that many of us will be in our best version , and immediately , and more , we 're going to solve the problem , and then it 's going to try to try to try to try to try
and in reality , if we fail to grow up , we 're often going to make ourselves different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel ourselves , we feel guilty , maybe depressed , frustrated or the <unk> .
these feelings we never have , when we play games , they 're not just going to do it .
and that 's what i wanted to do as a student .
why is it in play , you ca n't think it could n't be possible ?
how can we make these emotions of the reality ?
so i looked at the world of warcraft , the ideal environment to solve the ideal environment .
and i 've got some things that i 've been able to do the epic <unk> in the future .
so , first , if you put this online game , especially in the world , there 's a lot of different characters that are willing to be willing to be willing to be a mission , and it 's going to be a little bit more interesting .
but not only a mission , but a mission that is going to be perfect to your current level in the game , right ?
so you do that .
you never get a job that you ca n't solve .
but the point on the side of your skills , you have to do it , but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you 're not around it , and it 's always been a lot of <unk> to do it .
and there are lots of employees .
where you 're going to go hundreds of thousands of people who are working with their mission to be able to be able to do their mission .
that 's the real life that we 're not just doing that that is that a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
and also , there 's the epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're doing it and we have to do what we do .
then we 're going to get this whole positive feedback .
they have heard of `` <unk> , '' and `` <unk> '' is `` intelligence '' or intelligence intelligence .
this is the feedback , not in the real life .
if i 'm going to leave this stage , i 'm not talking about any <unk> , and it 's crazy crazy idea , crazy idea .
i get the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of the world is the world of warcraft is that it 's so close to the edge of the <unk> , that we 're going to spend our whole time in this time .
they 're just better than the reality .
and today , all of the world has spent more of the world for three years to solve the virtual problems of the problem .
that 's not necessarily something bad .
it sounds like bad .
but it 's to see it in the context , three million years ago , we started to go to the first time .
so the first time you ever get more .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend time , it 's just a sense of time that you 're going to think about the time of the human development of the human development , which is extraordinarily important .
but it 's true . because it turns out that we 're using this whole time to use the world , actually , what we 're doing as humans .
we 're going to connect us to each other , very different .
that 's the truth . i think i think .
look at this interesting statistic that recently recently published a researcher published the carnegie mellon university , the average young man in a country with a country with a country with 10,000 hours of the 21st century .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of two reasons .
first , for children , in the united states , the most important time they 're paying attention to school , the first time , the school of the school , the high school school , if you never have .
so we 've got a full of <unk> to the young people , what it means is a good player to be , like everything else in school .
and maybe some of you have to read the new book of malcolm jefferson , `` <unk> . ''
so you know , the theory of success is the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great research that we 've been talking about , when we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> of the world , for the 21st century , we 're going to be on the <unk> .
we 're going to do that as well as the most important people in the world .
so what we 've got here is a whole generation of young people who are struggling .
so the big question is : `` what are you doing ? ''
because if we could figure out , we would never have to be able to have a human potential for the potential .
so many people have been in the world , at least one hour per day .
this is our three million people who are extraordinary , good , in something .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinary , which is all of the same .
if you do n't have it .
the <unk> is working on the energy and work on work , instead of the <unk> , the most important players in the world , especially in india , china , in brazil .
you expect a extra billion player in the next decade .
we have a billion player .
so i started thinking about what it 's going to do with us .
here 's the four things that i found . first ,
ok , they think that 's the same thing .
and so , the desire to do is to do something , a <unk> , and that 's what we believe that we have a good hope for success .
players believe that it 's a security victory , and it 's still it it 's going to try and it 's just the same .
players do n't sit around .
players are masters of the spiders of social nets .
there 's a lot of interesting research that we 've got to do , we 've got to be able to do that as we 've been doing it , even though they were not done .
the reason that it is a lot of trust to play with someone play .
we trust that every time we 're going to spend the rules that we 're going to be the same goal , and to keep the way to stay .
so this is going to be the <unk> of the <unk> and trust , and each other .
as a result of this , we 're going to build social social relationships .
and more productivity .
you know , there 's a reason that the reason for the highest time of the last time , for a week , for a week , as a <unk> .
the reason is that when we 're playing , we 're actually happy to work hard to work when we 're doing something , or nothing .
we know that we know that we 're going to be human beings , when we work hard to work hard .
and players are always ready to work hard to work when they get the right task .
and finally , i 'm going to be epic .
players love it to be part of the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
so here 's a <unk> to the right light . you know all wikipedia , the biggest thing .
the second is the world , with almost a <unk> , the world of warcraft .
five million people are using every month .
they have more information about world of warcraft in the internet , as a different world in any other world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so that 's four superpowers who are going to get a single outcome , and the players are , and the most hopeful individuals .
there are people who believe that you can change the world .
and the only problem is that you believe you can think of the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem that i 'm trying to do .
edward , is a <unk> .
his work is great . he 's why people spend much time , energy and money .
and he says , `` we 're not going to be <unk> of less than a virtual worlds and the <unk> . ''
and this is an economist . so he 's feeling it .
and he says ...
not like i -- i 'm going to play a lot of games , i 'm going to be a little bit .
so he says , `` it makes sense , '' because players can be more likely to be in the real life .
they can make more social social bonds in the real life , and they get more feedback and reward games in the real life .
so he says , it 's actually true that players are more than the virtual world in the virtual world .
i 'm just trying to make it feel .
but it 's definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to make the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , the number of years .
there 's these <unk> <unk> , you know , you know ?
this fantastic <unk> <unk> was .
and that was the first of people came to the first of people .
and if you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , you know , you know , this story , and how they were invented .
according to the more successful games , more than the <unk> , in the kingdom , in the world , has been invented in a famine .
it was a big famine that was the king of the <unk> was a crazy idea .
people were sick . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented it , according to the same , and the <unk> of a national strategy , and you would eat a day , and you would be going to play the next day .
and they would be so much in the <unk> , so that 's kind of interesting , and we 're talking about our own productivity , and that 's the way that they would remember that it was n't too much .
and then , the next day you would play , and then the next day you eat .
and according to the same time , you 've been 18 years long for the famine , they were going to walk on a day and the next time .
so , i think we 're playing games .
we 're playing games to be the suffering of the real world .
we 're playing a lot of things that are not working in the real world , especially in the real life , and we 're going to get we to play the way we need .
but that 's not the end .
this is the interesting thing .
according to 18 years , the famine was n't better , so i decided to be the king , a last year .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they were a <unk> and the winner had to be a <unk> of adventure .
they went to the <unk> and they were looking for a new home , and they were just so much people to go back to the food , and then they were looking at the rest of a place where they were able to live .
it sounds crazy , or ?
but the latest <unk> shows that the first time that the <unk> was the same rich , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so , scientists have been recently known to be the notion of the story that the story is really true .
and <unk> found evidence of global <unk> that almost 20 years ago , which was the famine .
so , this crazy story is true .
maybe they actually have their people by being rescued by their years , and they had been able to have been able to have a lot of time and then that kind of <unk> and that they learned that they were going to learn the whole civilization of the
so , that can be the way we can .
we 're talking about in 1994 .
this was the first time in real time , and this was 16 years ago .
they were 18 years for 18 years , we 've been using 16 years .
i 'm going to tell you , we 're ready to make our own <unk> .
so , they sent half their civilization to the world for a new world , so i 'm going to take my 21 billion dollars a week .
we should be in the fact that half of us is a day of a day , with the problems we have to solve the problems of the real world .
i know , you know , `` how do we solve problems in the real world ? '' and that 's what i 've done my work in the last years of the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , and we should be able to understand the future .
we do n't want to try to tell the future .
what we want to do is the future .
we want to be the best result , and then people can think about this idea that we do .
we 're going to give us a <unk> and give people the opportunity to achieve them .
i 'm going to show you three games that i 've designed to try to try to try to try to try to make people in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
this game is from 2007 .
it 's a piece of a game that you need to have a chance to have .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough to be it for it , and you can make it better in the world , but you can do it in the game , if you 're going to tell you , and you 're going to ask you
we have this game with the first players in 2007 , and we 've got it over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change life because it 's good for the environment or because we should be .
but if you 're in a <unk> adventure , and i said , `` we 're going to go out of the oil . ''
this is an amazing adventure , which is that you 're going to go .
find out how they survive , most of our players are able to be able to make their mental habits .
so we 've got to have the next time to be a bigger amount of time , more than just the first time .
we have the game `` <unk> '' for the future .
now , the point is that the <unk> of the only one that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this <unk> means `` global , '' means , `` global . ''
the call on players , we have almost like a <unk> , `` <unk> . ''
you know , you know , you know , the <unk> of the <unk> , where it 's the <unk> , they have the astronauts , the scientists who are the <unk> , and only they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , `` it 's our job , and it 's our job , for energy , health , health , security , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that can read you , if you 're `` <unk> . ''
and the last game we do . it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
if you 're going to finish the game , you will be the world bank , the u.s. of the world , the <unk> of the world , 2010 .
we work with universities in africa and they 're trying to learn social services .
we have a comic comic project . we 've got to be more <unk> , and we need to understand , and it 's , sustainability , vision and <unk> .
i want to share with you that game with young people who are all over the world , especially in the world , that they can use their own social social system to save the world .
i 'm going to go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think , what 's next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that we can do , but we have n't have the real world .
well , i hope that you agree with that players that the players are human resources that we can make in the real life , and that games are a great meaning for change .
we 've got these whole superpowers , despite productivity , the ability to support social networks and the desire to be important .
i hope that we 're going to play a lot of games to be able to do this planet in this planet .
and i hope you will play with me and play .
when i went to the next decade , i 'm going to be two things that we can create every single future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i 'm going to tell you that the game is playing games .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something about a few months ago in a journal of a journal of a journal of the world .
i 've been talking about my <unk> , but i was working with the <unk> of the <unk> , and i realized that i never had to have my life in my life , which is the word `` <unk> '' .
i read you the post .
`` as a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
and , healthy , healthy , strong . ''
i 've got this list of a friend , and i had to be able to read it , but i was just just the same , but i was just until the <unk> and i had n't had to read , and i had to read the first
of course , it was a <unk> , old , i thought , i thought that the song was pretty old .
but actually , it was a copy of the early '80s when i started at the school and started to explore my own self from my family and form , and also , in other children , and the rest of the world around me .
and god is not going to use a lot of time .
i would like to take this one seriously seriously , i would be born in a world who would be like a person who would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
so i was thinking about the ted of 2009 , and i think that i 've got to be a <unk> .
here 's the <unk> version of this .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
especially , i 'm going to say the last two words in `` <unk> '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just the words .
it 's about what we think about people who are talking about these words .
it 's about the values that are in these words , and how we do these values .
our language determines our way and how we see the world and people around us .
many of the societies , including the greeks , the greeks , and the <unk> , really , that the <unk> has a great force , because that 's what you can say , it 's going to be true .
so what we want to do is -- a human beings , a powerful people ?
and only to be a human child , you might be able to do it , and they 're going to be <unk> and they 're going to be informed .
would n't be nice to open doors .
one person who was open for me was my <unk> , my home , in the first year , in the <unk> .
he 's called dr. <unk> , and a more <unk> , which is how you think , most americans ca n't be wrong , so he was called dr. <unk> .
and dr. <unk> was very <unk> , and it was just the work with children as a <unk> .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my job .
i had to have to keep a little bit more difficult to keep it with this huge , more <unk> , in different colors -- that you know , i know , and i 've got to share this . i 've got it . i 've got it
and imagine , i even have to be married as a child with dr. <unk> and trying to try to stop those exercises without success .
and one day he was looking at my own exercises -- these exercises were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said , `` wow , you 're so strong , and young girl , you 'll be a <unk> of one of these <unk> .
and if you can use it , i 'll give you a hundred dollars . ''
this was just a simple trick of dr. <unk> , which i do n't want to do with the exercises that i was not trying to do with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the hospital in the second floor , but he actually has to help me
and i wonder how much of my vision of my vision and a lot of young young girls and i could imagine myself as a nature of nature , and i can see it as a very powerful way to see .
this is just a example of many , how adults are in the imagination of a child .
but as the most <unk> examples of the evidence , we do n't have to make our language a space , something that we would all wish to be all of us , to give each individual people to see themselves as a powerful people .
our language is that the social changes that we 've been in many cases in a technological change .
from the medical perspective , you can say , that 's my legs , the best for three , and artificial <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the ability to make people really open to their own , and the way to create their own communities , and the way
so perhaps this technological change is more important because there 's always another truth , that everyone has a human society , and that is a very powerful ability to be able to be able to be able to be able to be our biggest <unk> .
the human ability to be -- this is a interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how to do with a <unk> and i 'm going to tell you a little bit of that sentence , i 've never been thinking , and i think
this sentence is from <unk> with the idea of the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge to be a challenge of being a <unk> experience , as if my life was so successful , because i can be able to be able to be able to
but the truth is that we 're changing ourselves , and we 're the challenge of the challenge , whether you 're physically physically , or even more , it 's also the same .
and i 'm saying that 's good .
and there are no obstacle that we need to have to be able to get to our lives .
<unk> are just our lives .
and i tend to be able to see something like my shadow .
sometimes i see that he 's very busy , sometimes he 's not going to see it , but he 's always the time .
and i want to do that with the impact of the impact , and the hard of the people who have a <unk> of the <unk> .
there are in life and challenges and the ones that are only more real and every person is different , but the question is not whether we 're going to do things or not , but we 're going to get out of it .
so we 're not just responsible for that people who love to love , but they also pay for it to be good .
and we do n't have to do our kids , if we give them the feeling that they ca n't adapt .
you have to have two things to be <unk> , and the medical fact , and the other thing is to be a social society , whether i 'm not a <unk> or not .
and to be honest , the only real real and a disability , i 've been trying to get to the world , that the world is always , you can describe me with this .
in our desire , people who are fighting the heart of the heart , and you have to tell the cool truth to be the medical action , or even a prediction to the quality of life , which is not to be the <unk> that we 're going
maybe this is the concept of the concept that 's just going to be in a <unk> , and how we fix it , for every single disability , a bigger disability than the <unk> .
if we do n't have a human condition , and not all of its forces and opportunities and we can recognize that , we have to be able to have a <unk> of the natural struggle , which is another disease .
we need to give a people who has a value of our society .
so we need to look at the <unk> and all of us to see the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it 's between the perception of our power and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should n't be able to do this , but we should n't be able to do it , but we should n't try to avoid it , but it 's going to be the <unk> of the <unk> , but it 's about the <unk> opportunity .
it 's probably about that , that we do n't have to be able to do that , but we 're not going to have to be open , but we 're going to give you a chance to give you a more efficient way to use it to
and maybe we can do it , it 's something that 's natural as a natural gas , and useful and useful , and so , that 's not going to be the presence of our presence .
in this year , we 're going to get 200 of the 200 <unk> of charles darwin and he talked about 150 years ago , he has been <unk> , in my eyes , in a very real human character .
i would like it , not the most powerful of his way , and not the best of its way , but the changes of the best changes .
and in conflict , creativity is creativity .
not just darwin 's work that we know that the ability of people to survive , and the struggle of human mind is to be changing in conflict .
so , again , change and <unk> , the great skills of people .
and maybe we know , what 's going to be the wood of what we 're going to be <unk> , when we 're going to be <unk> .
perhaps that 's the sense of <unk> , an perception of the <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can do ourselves ourselves .
we can create a new meaning that 's going to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
maybe we can see things as changing as the change .
<unk> is a change that we 've not adapted to .
i think the biggest harm we have to have ourselves on ourselves , we think we 're normal .
and the moment is , who 's normal ?
there 's no normal .
there 's the usual . the typical ones , but not the normal , and you would be able to do those poor , you know , you know , if you want to do it , you know , if you were really ?
i think it 's not .
it would be great if we think this paradigm of <unk> , or the strength of the strength , even even though it could be able to be able to be able to be able to do that , and we can share the forces of many children ,
and so , we found that we 've found people who have been a <unk> of society , and that 's a <unk> to do .
there 's evidence that that 's happening from the <unk> years of population people and people with severe physical injuries , and that was perhaps because the life was in the way that people had been in the society .
they did n't have these people as the <unk> and <unk> , they were something that 's valuable and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in the city where i grew up in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the northeast , and i was a <unk> <unk> .
it was summer and i had to be full-time .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , `` well , if this is not <unk> . ''
and i 'm looking at this old man . i did n't know what he 's .
and i said , `` excuse me , sir , you know , i ca n't remember you . ''
and he said , `` well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
when i first saw the first time , i was looking at her mother . ''
oh , so .
and of course , it 's made it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who was just looking for stories of my mother , because i was , of course , i was very typical , my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for the <unk> <unk> , my mother was on vacation , and i knew my parents who were the man who was not in the world .
and because i was born with my <unk> , and my feet after you were looking at a few toes , and i just had a few toes on the other hand , he had to be able to tell the bad news to the bad news .
he said , `` i had to tell you my parents , never going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
really extraordinary , i realized that he had my whole childhood , but i had no longer in the second grade , if i had to talk to the <unk> of the <unk> , i had to be able to talk to the <unk> of the medical school ,
and he called this part of his <unk> , the potential of the human <unk> .
you ca n't just be able to calculate how to be the factor of this factor of human beings .
and dr. <unk> told me , he said , `` i 've learned that kids do n't have to be something that they 're not going to be a little bit more than you 're going to get a little more support , if you can go to your
you see dr. <unk> has changed .
he had understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone does , you know , two different things are .
and i think i think that i think when you were in the age of 15 years , if i had my <unk> <unk> , and bone and bone , i would n't have a second .
i wanted to be able to do it in the same way .
if you ask me , i 'm not sure that 's safe .
and that 's because i 'm going to do something with my legs and not even even though this experiences .
and perhaps that change , because i 've been so many people who have been open to me , and i 've been trying to get people to get me to the idea of the time , and i wanted to give you a idea of the idea .
you see it really just just a people who can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
if you give someone to make your own body , the human mind , the human mind is that you want to be able to do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you 're going to open these people in a very good teacher .
they 're going to open up to the doors .
the real meaning of the word `` <unk> '' is the word `` `` <unk> '' .
it means something that 's in a way that 's the potential .
again , what 's the potential to do , we want to go to this ?
in the '60s , in britain , in britain , we had been approved in the 1960s .
they call it the <unk> `` <unk> '' in the united states , `` we call it the <unk> . ''
the students are going to be <unk> .
and the one students have to be more effective to have more effective , better teachers , and so they have to be better .
they 've been talking about a <unk> while students have a little bit of the note , `` very good . '' they said , they were very smart , and after those three months , they were really <unk> .
and of course , it 's the heart of the heart that 's going to be the other , you know , it 's just enough .
and it was just the three months .
but only that the ones that are still in school -- besides the students who were going to school .
and the question was that the teachers were not working .
the teachers did n't know that something changed .
they were just told that the student and the students are the best ones with the note , and they have to teach them something they 're taught .
the only real disability is a completely <unk> spirit , the broken mind , no hope , no hope . he does n't have anything . it 's no natural , and our imagination , our imagination .
if we do it , we can help the human spirit to help , and other people are around to find it , and so , in fact , we 're going to be able to make our forces really positive .
if you have a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new .
i want to end with a poem that was from a <unk> poet , <unk> <unk> , and from my friend , and he said , `` the <unk> of the god , '' and the poem is `` the god , '' `` the god , '' he
come on , dance . thank you .
