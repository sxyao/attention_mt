yes , good day , ladies .
so you 're very much for the invitation here today .
and i have to imagine myself .
my name is christian , and i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to be <unk> , the city is the city .
that 's what we 're going to have to be about eight years .
and my favorite is : first , the first <unk> , two organization , three , the public policy .
so i 'm responsible for the <unk> of this city .
and so , you do n't know .
i know .
and it 's what 's going to be a little bit of my son , i 'm also going to be working .
this is the head of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the more <unk> and half of the time .
and i think i think about this is a topic that i want to talk to you today .
and the theme of the <unk> of the <unk> , because it 's going to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
we hope to be best and we 're going to be on the worst thing that 's called the <unk> .
you know it .
he was even at general .
and then i start to do something very much about this .
i 'm going to give you a chance .
so , if you 're going to talk about a risk that we 're going to be a risk of a catastrophe , for example , <unk> , <unk> .
many people are on the way .
it 's really important .
and somewhere on the edge of a suitcase , a suitcase , you know , you have to be <unk> , maybe you might be <unk> .
nobody seems to be there .
the suitcase is not any .
suddenly a <unk> .
and they 're going to leave the date .
police come to <unk> , <unk> .
people call it .
<unk> <unk> .
go out .
what 's right ? well , the question .
we do n't know we ca n't tell you .
the people are going to leave the building .
children crying .
some of you may even be able to go to it , because it 's going to go to it .
suddenly , a <unk> .
it 's in the middle .
a panic is coming out .
i 'm going to hear this .
the rest of your imagination is the imagination .
but it 's not a imagination that i have to have .
this is what happened in this week .
there 's a little suitcase .
and then they found that , in fact , nine pounds of drugs were in the <unk> .
but the people were just like this , and so this is a friend of mine , who was <unk> .
it was nothing .
and it was just that this kind of <unk> suddenly in the group of the <unk> , my friend in my friend was .
god is n't a panic , otherwise , would n't be <unk> , so it seems to be <unk> .
you see , in a <unk> disaster , it 's a very important thing .
communication is important because people in this situation is <unk> in the situation .
you want to know what 's going to go .
in the good , old time , the <unk> was just just the <unk> .
we have n't have to have it , or we have lied .
why ?
because the <unk> is going to be <unk> .
you have to say , `` god , people who come out of panic , we do n't want to tell the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a time of social media , in a time of twitter , in a period of facebook , in a period of private media and public media , in a time of public and public tv .
and so , and it 's not because it 's not moral , and the second most important is that we 're going to have the last time the last time that report in the event .
you remember , at the end of the car , it 's a year , it 's a year .
the first news was about twitter .
someone who was on a <unk> and just <unk> and immediately , and it 's a plane , and we save people .
that was not a <unk> .
you see , we 're going to be on the way that we 're just trying to be able to say , and and it 's really to be very <unk> to be <unk> .
because most of the most important , we 've also been the last thing that we know , because we have to be considered , because we need to be the most important information that we 're just going to use to just be able to share information .
and it 's public media or private media either not just very much , or they do n't just do it .
so , we 're going to eat food , and that 's also something that 's been going to be the media , we think about how we 're going to work in the future .
and we 're going to be the good old <unk> <unk> .
but just as a form of the <unk> .
that 's what we 're going to be going to be in the next few years , to be a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , which is some of you know that you know , because it 's going to be the first time .
it was so much .
you know , you know , you know , what three times short , once you 'll just wait , and once you go .
i do n't know anymore .
we 're going to be going to be all of the time that we 've been working on this , and so , on facebook , about facebook , about twitter , on the radio , on the internet , and on the internet and the media and the
and we know we need to be very fast and <unk> and we have to get very fast and <unk> , because the citizens will be <unk> .
and we also do n't want to believe what we want to say .
communication in the crisis , in the crisis , is a question of the <unk> of all media , and it 's also a question of the <unk> .
the <unk> is our biggest problem , because the citizens and citizens say , `` oh , it 's not going to be wrong , but they say , it 's all more worse than it 's in reality .
we 've also been doing good experiences with facebook and twitter , and i 've been recently recently recently .
so , you may have some of them in the media .
we have a bigger amount of food in the food .
and it 's a <unk> chemical bomb .
these are bombs who are with a <unk> , because the only time we do n't want to go to the first time , but in the world , the <unk> of the world , and the only two of the <unk> , and the ground is the <unk>
the problem is only , many of these bombs have never been working in the same way , and as we 've been looking at the same for the other countries .
and there were a older gentleman who 's like to be <unk> in the <unk> , and he said , `` we 've got to see it , and he had to be <unk> , and he 's going to be the authority of the <unk> that it 's
by the way , there 's several older women , i 've been talking about all the time .
we 'll see what we 're going to find .
these bombs have to be place , not , but it 's going to be <unk> .
and so we 've got to go in the <unk> park , and it 's a kind of <unk> , which is a <unk> of the word .
and the time in the history of the city of the entire communication of facebook and twitter , and i 'll start with the consequence that the whole lot of all has been been talking about all more than the whole year .
and the media was really excited . it 's the background .
we did n't have to have the phone , but the ones that have been working and <unk> , and all of them , and twitter .
this whole thing has been a great effect for us , because the consumer is going to be <unk> by the social media .
just , you have to give me a sign of what i should stop .
i ca n't look at the watch .
this is the <unk> because of the first social media that has been able to make it information .
not so much , because the members of the u.s. or the <unk> is the <unk> , you have to be a high school .
second , fast .
if anything is not true , somebody 's more likely to be the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , which i 've been talking about , because the whole community is basically the whole community in the world .
and it 's a very high quality of so , so if anything wrong , it can be very fast .
and we have a huge amount of interest .
i said , `` well , what 's really exciting to the most interesting thing is that a bomb in the <unk> park .
so , we 've got all of the things that happened in the last few years , and it 's more more than a lot of more than a <unk> , and it 's a little bit more than a <unk> .
the city can eat every day of a catastrophe .
one bomb that has been in a park , certainly not a way .
but you can also also be able to go and also , and then we 're going to be able to be in the <unk> , and then we 're going to be on our <unk> and try to get the seven feet of the <unk> .
and if you think , in <unk> , you think about other cities , if you have to be , because they 're going to have a so-called <unk> , you ca n't have to do the <unk> , you know , now , you know , you 're
and that 's important , because it 's in a world 's world 's really important , to help it , to help it , to prevent the people that are willing to help people have to make the people that they are able to be able to do
and the social media help us be to be <unk> , because it 's all of the communication of communication , and it 's not just a <unk> achievement that we 've been working in the election , and certainly even in the great part of the great part
so , not the <unk> , not only a job of the authorities , not just a job of the department or the department of the state , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , but communication , but communication is a catastrophe of the disaster .
and it 's shown that .
there 's about twitter and facebook , a lot of the help , because it 's also been because of it , because of all of the people had to be <unk> and they did n't know what they were going to be .
this is also a lot of work , but for the public communications , but the unprecedented company has been working with the private media and the <unk> , that the social media has been a <unk> of a <unk> of communication to not be more way to think
and i hope i hope that i 've been convinced that this medium is that the most important things that 's been used in the most difficult things , and in the fact , in the sense of the world , and it 's also the way that we
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm going to be different .
i 'm a writer and i 've heard you 've heard about it .
and i 'm still going to have a own time to have a own .
what it 's that i 'm going to do is that i 'm going to make it in the same way , and i 'll tell you that i 'm going to be going to be a little bit of it .
before i do , i need to have a couple of things .
the first thing is , i think we 're really interested in life .
we ca n't live without stories .
and i think that it 's very much more more than more important , more than the entertainment system is produced by the entertainment system .
and then i think that the internet is , the <unk> , that 's really good as any of our best <unk> , right .
and four , i 'm convinced that people were being created to be creative .
and they 're happier , as they can be creative .
the more people are happy , the better is the world .
it 's very scary .
this better world is just a <unk> .
in the first line , i 'm like , i said , storyteller .
and the story that i want to tell you about at midnight is a <unk> , which is going to be happy to be happy .
that 's the <unk> .
and it 's been the ultimate birthday .
now , you get the <unk> and the singing , because you 're not going to be a little bit of time , because it 's going to be a little bit about it .
it 's something in your head , your body , with your perception .
and they did n't really have words .
you know , what happens .
i 've been doing words .
i call the <unk> of the <unk> .
you see the one on the side of the side and the <unk> and everything is quite black .
i feel that i 'm pretty much of it .
and it 's true .
and on the other side , we have the two of the world in the country , with a lot of color .
and it was in this point that i was better , and i write that i 'm going to write a <unk> .
so , the first thing that you 've seen with your new perception is a <unk> man , a <unk> man , who 's a <unk> , you know , you 're very seriously , and say , congratulations , your life is over .
that 's the <unk> .
and it 's also more important to think about that , they 're very different of people .
she was born as a <unk> .
players are people who are going to be their <unk> to their lifetime .
who 's what you know ?
very nice .
imagine that the <unk> does n't have to be <unk> , if you 're going to meet them , but it 's the <unk> of the pocket .
so , you have to have , , everything , everything .
what really important is that the players have no idea of their experience .
we know , we know , when we die .
i wish every long life is not just that we do n't know .
it can be good . it 's going to be over .
and so , it 's going to be my players .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
that means , every single minute , has been the last year .
a player who has been given his entire life , and the moment of the moment of the moment , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> .
now , you can ask , if you ask , if you 're so dangerous , why do you do that ?
the answer is clear .
without play , without a player , you 're all a <unk> , and just a player , it 's actually alive .
the ones were born .
so , that 's what i 'm doing .
and this story of the story and how you 're going to see the world of the player , their first challenges , and of course , in love , that 's the story that i want to tell you .
and it 's a <unk> .
the first one is 12 , sorry , i 'm going to have a little bit of that i 've been late .
so , 12 , 12 , the first one of the first time with a length of five minutes .
this kind of , the kind of <unk> , a series of others , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
and the television does n't have to be on its own .
this is not new .
and if it 's all , i 've got to be done .
and then , not here .
now , it 's just right .
let 's go back to the back again .
what is the most famous sentence from the movie or the series ?
it can just be a <unk> , right .
thank you .
when we were doing that .
and that 's what 's not going to be on my players .
and there 's lots of things that can be there .
there are many different games .
think about it , it 's more important , and so on , and so forth .
and so , the number of players are the number of players .
and so , there 's a lot of stories that everybody wants to be .
now , the next question is : who should you do that ?
i 've been a pretty high opinion .
i think it 's very smart , and extremely creative .
but i know that a hundred brains more than only one of the one is , when it 's mine .
so it was the idea that you 're going to do with the <unk> of the creative process .
what if we do n't just want to be just just just just or not , but even more importantly ?
so if you say , we 're going to be very much a little bit of that that 's going to be going to be able to do this .
imagine , for example , in the case of three years , you have a <unk> , which is totally true , because he 's for the <unk> of her grandfather .
and also , they 're a huge fan of the <unk> .
and then you can just be able to do this with technology , that 's not much more difficult to do it .
and this store is to go up to the top , where it 's going to be right , and that 's really cool to really be really interested in the audience .
it 's not going to be there , but it 's not going to be right there , where it 's going to be going to be the way it should be .
that 's really beautiful that we 're in the internet .
and the internet can really make it all .
so , every medium is somehow <unk> .
this is what you can do , you can write a person , you can draw , whatever you want to do .
and if we look at this structure .
that 's the same thing to be more <unk> , or ?
so this is what we 're going to be built in the <unk> .
and i 'm really convinced that the internet was born to be the way to tell stories of stories .
it 's not just not much , but no , no , no , no .
so , i 'm going to go back and even further further and give the audience to the player .
and it 's in a <unk> .
there can be a <unk> of the people in the front of the <unk> , but people in the real environment , that they have to have their mobile phone .
and the <unk> , you know , all of you are very good , so that 's something like mobile and private leaders .
these wonderful areas that are very rapidly going to develop very rapidly .
and i ca n't get it because i would have to be going to be going to be 20 minutes .
we 're going to go together .
everyone 's worth three parts .
the first part is the first part of the second part of the second , and we have to have the same .
and i could have been able to have the judges , i 've got to be able to get the <unk> of the first , which is the <unk> innovation .
the first price for the best for the best .
and i need to say , this was the judges of the <unk> , from the <unk> , and the <unk> , and so forth .
so , you know , you should be able to do my job .
and if i can convince you , here 's my favorite internet , the internet is really using new structures , the way i can do , , i think , i can do it .
so , that 's what i 'm doing .
everybody 's time , why is that all right ?
because it 's just in this <unk> <unk> .
we 've got the first one of the first one , who 's one , i 'm going to be here , you 're going to be one of it .
and of course , the death .
in the series of a lot , it 's very much .
everybody 's worth it , everybody has to die .
and then , of course , everyone is , every one of everyone 's going to be able to be able to see it .
that 's totally important .
i come out of the <unk> and there 's nothing worse than my opinion when it 's going to be a bit .
i do n't know if you know that .
if you 're in the theater and then the actor , the actor in the auditorium and all of the , oh , oh , please , please .
and that 's not .
so it 's volunteers .
and nobody needs to have .
he can just be just the audience .
the reason why i 'm talking about this is the whole project that i was going to be in german ,
that 's a few reasons .
i 'm going to start with this project , and i always thought , `` well , i 've been going to go to the whole , and the whole , <unk> , blah , blah , blah blah .
i can say , `` the german , the third of the world is the third world .
the <unk> is the english , then the spanish and the german .
so it 's not so much as we would be in a little <unk> .
and also , i really really think really , if it 's other people like that , i think that people will be grateful for something that 's not going to be a little bit of any more than the end of the day and every <unk> of the
if it 's all like it , i 'd like to be able to have the first time , the first time i 've been working on the first time .
and if you ask , why i 'm going to be here , because there 's a <unk> where it 's under the <unk> election , the <unk> <unk> .
i 've been doing some of it .
i love to be <unk> .
not just .
i 'm also pretty much dependent on the federal and <unk> .
and a few of them were also working in the same .
and i can say , that 's really important that this whole knowledge is incredibly important , and incredibly <unk> .
but it 's not all anything if you do n't have it .
and my project is just the same thing i 've been doing for all of the time i 've learned .
and it 's done .
and so far , it 's good .
i can just say it 's just a little bit .
so , if you think somebody 's thinking , i want to be part of my part , i have to be a idea of a idea , or i have to be a <unk> , or i have to be a little bit of the same thing ,
you find it in the internet .
on facebook .
great , like the speaker .
yes , i 'm going to be able to do it .
welcome to you , can you be selfish ?
question .
can you try memories ?
can you remember all what happened in your life ?
have you still forgotten ?
who has to remember all of us ?
it 's not a hands .
so , can you do memories ?
it 's already .
thank you .
no , so we do n't want to do it .
and then the talk is pretty short .
again , my name is samuel .
the talk today , i 've been going to give me my two , because he 's two my passions and my two big passions .
i 've been able to go through the <unk> and <unk> with the bits and <unk> , which is the world that are going to fly over the world .
and i 'm also going to be a <unk> and <unk> and a <unk> and <unk> in the private sector .
so on the side of the page , i 've been working with the computer with the computer , so i 'm going to be on the other side of the human rights , so how does it work with the human rights ?
how can you change it ?
and that 's what you 're looking at .
i was a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , and <unk> .
so , the question was , when we can , when we can build a computer , how does the human brain ?
and i think that 's pretty close to it .
so i think you have two years , three hundred years , no longer does n't need more .
but let me tell you why you should have the idea that it 's going to be more important .
so the relationship between the computer on the side of the side and our brain on the other side .
if we take the computer , then you 're all right , you 're going to be your smartphone , you can be able to use your smartphone , and you all have these cameras and all all these smart people in the little chip .
he 's called <unk> , central <unk> .
these parts are together by tiny transistors .
the word has heard everyone 's ever heard , and in the moment , it 's going to be a <unk> .
the little little device that has got three degrees and <unk> , or not to do it .
in our computer , we 've got to have a little bit of our lab , and i 've got to get three hundred hundred million of these little pieces of these little pieces .
and the <unk> is <unk> .
we 're going to do things we 're doing , we 've got to be able to see it , we know , we can hear the <unk> einstein , but can you say , `` can you can be able to can be able to be able to
more ca n't .
he 's actually pretty <unk> .
let 's try to compare this with our brain .
our brain has been a little bit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have to have it , and i have to have a hundred billion neurons in the gray crowd , in the gray crowd .
but the beautiful but our our neurons are not just three connections but the ones that has to be a neuron .
and that 's a little bit of the <unk> , just because it 's good , it 's 10 trillion .
this is 10 <unk> <unk> .
so , you know , you know , the complexity of our brain is more than what we 're going to do with computers .
and we want to compare the idea of the time , maybe the one or other , the first supercomputer that we had to have their own <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the campus was the <unk> of the campus
our <unk> , sometimes , but the box is there , it 's about 20 watts .
and the one is that the equivalent of two big bananas , so you do n't need them and your computer , it 's wonderful .
if we have to have a little good good part of the top , you have to add a little good computer , for the same time , why do n't we do that , why do we do things ?
maybe one of the other things that you have in the internet , that is the human use of the brain , you 're using the first 10 percent of the brain , and they 're going to be able to be able to be able to get to
and the more <unk> is a little bit about the advertising .
ten percent may be , but our brain is actually in our evolution of our evolution , that was the same , in the middle of the middle , it 's still the <unk> , all of the other things ,
that 's not because we do n't use it .
why seems that we 're going to be the biggest part of this ?
maybe you know , the term of the world ?
i mean , as you can see , as you see the iceberg , if you see the iceberg in the sea , you can see the top , the top , the bottom is the bottom , the bottom is a <unk> .
and these 10 percent of the top is that this is what our unconscious our unconscious is , but the <unk> is , but the <unk> is a huge amount of <unk> , and it 's a huge amount of <unk> .
we need to explain the first we we need to act better , we need to act more slow , we need to be creative .
and that 's what i 've been going to be on , and that 's what 's going to be more likely to be on the memory , maybe it 's a different person , or other people with the other memory .
people who had all more detail than i did n't have seen the situation in the situation , and the other , i said , `` yes , but what do you know ?
this is there , there 's a special thing , which is a little bit , which is a <unk> , which is , somebody who 's in a <unk> , who is a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , and it
and not somehow , this is the river , and there 's no one , every single house every single door , every single door , he had seen it , he had to put it back to paper .
where does this go ?
so why can that tell you that we ca n't have that , but that 's probably the fact that the more important way to have more than the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
now , now we 're also looking at the yes , but why ca n't i remember the last night in the last night , in all the details ?
and the <unk> , i 've been interested in the interesting experiences .
he has been also used for the economic revolution , and also with a cancer experience that had been completely <unk> , that was not more than the <unk> of the brain , which is not that it 's gone .
wonderful , very good .
now , it 's really about the people .
there 's a very safe conversation , and if you could be able to see this event , if you could n't remember , you could imagine the <unk> of the car that you could see in the people that that was not the <unk> <unk>
and actually , in this particular section , it was a <unk> .
the second thing i was doing was , he was a lady in a <unk> , who told her mother her mother 's <unk> in the <unk> room , as she was small , so four years .
and she sat on her mother and her mother .
and then he said , `` well , it 's a <unk> , but it 's time .
and then they started to read it , she was four times when it 's not going to read it , but you could n't read it .
and then they said , `` he told me that i 'm going to tell you the first time .
you have a copy of the <unk> in <unk> , where this is the text of the text , the lady read the lady .
so the brain has this page as she was , as a picture .
and then you read it .
so , we have to have access to it , but we 're actually looking at the normal life , we have to have to have to be more interested in the way we 're not working .
now , we ca n't think that 's what we 're looking at , but as the <unk> , he has a picture , a one of a sudden , a little bit , we can say , we 're going to be able to see what we 're
and it was , for a long evening , you 're going to go to the moment , but you 're going to go to the little , you 're going to go , and then you can ask you , you can just ask you , just just
and remember a very good , positive event in the past past , yes .
take the first thing .
and if you do that , you might be able to tell you that this memory is a visual part of it .
you may have a picture , maybe even a movie ?
some of the things that do n't do is that we 're not going to do it , but they 're going to do it as well as the first time .
and if you see that , you can be able to be able to see it in the movie , and you can see your eyes , or how you see yourself on a screen .
that 's what we call it , the other thing .
thank you , you can get the idea that you can get the eyes .
who has a visual information , which is a <unk> ?
yes , there 's a little bit of hands , that 's what i 'm going to say , `` well , i 'm going to tell you that , i think , is that what i 've been doing is that it 's something that we 're not
well , you go to the <unk> .
but what 's also true about memory , if you 're memory , not even though it 's not just that memory , the memory is , we have to be more important , and i think that 's a positive event , and i think that 's a
and now , what 's exciting .
and all of the time , yes , we have the brain that we do n't have a difference between what we actually have , and what we 're doing is what we 're doing .
and you can do it if you go to your home and you 're going to be a little bit of the future , that 's not going to be able to be able to make information like something else , when you remember something else .
and , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
and then , hey , it 's happening , and that was the thing that and the more and the longer the stories , the most beautiful thing is , the most beautiful thing , he was , because there was a lot of <unk> , because there was
if we do that , we 're going to make our memories so , so we do n't change our memories , why do we do that , so i do n't ask them ?
and i came back to my uncle , my uncle image , from his hut in switzerland .
a very beautiful picture , it 's also a very beautiful shock .
just , the image is , the <unk> , a little bit of the <unk> , it 's a <unk> , he told me , he 's <unk> , because it 's the <unk> of the <unk> , because it 's a beautiful dog , which is a beautiful
and why do n't we do that because our own thoughts , our own memories , hey , what i mean , when i do that , i 'm going to do that , what i do ?
they actually have artistic freedom in their own thoughts .
and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
yeah , i 've got bad , i was all the time to the head .
and the whole night and this thought i did n't have to go back .
i think it 's the way it did n't go to the way it 's going to go .
the son of my friend has been depressed by me , when he was germany , because he had his mother in hong kong , and he was just horrible .
what was the dad , he did , he had a night with the son , and she said , `` well , what was the most beautiful thing that happened ?
what was the most beautiful , and then he told him , he 's going to tell him it 's going to tell him what 's going to be a great thing .
and in two weeks , we went to the son .
and then it was all that the way that the <unk> is coming to us , and then the <unk> is coming back to us .
and the one is that the whole youth of the whole youth is about the most important people that i know .
so there are not the memories that we 're looking at us , but it 's our focus on our focus on what we use .
and how much energy we use is it .
so if you want to be more honest , or say , that 's what it 's now mathematically , that 's the <unk> , but it 's not the way that you do n't know , but you know , it 's going to be a little bit
what 's the <unk> , `` yeah , '' , `` oh , what beautiful , '' i mean , `` yes , i 've got to be really good , and that was the great thing that was beautiful ?
and then they take it .
take it with her and let them work .
or if you want to be a <unk> , you know , it 's your boss , or your wife , or her husband , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
so , you 're looking at this picture , you 're going to put it in a little bit of fun , hey , hey .
and so , three , more importantly , you 're going to go to the background , you 're going to go on the background , you know , you know , why do you laugh ?
because you have to think , because this thought is funny .
and you can see much better with the situation .
so can the memories are just <unk> ?
no , i think our brain has to be able to make it more accessible .
but it does n't matter because we can choose free , how much we focus on the focus , and how important we think , a memory , a memory , it 's coming on .
my favorite thing you 're doing with you , you 're using your <unk> , you 're going to use your power and give you every day that you can make your life .
good afternoon .
thank you .
if i 'm a party , i 'm going to talk to my work and tell me that i 'm going to share with friends with friends , and i see eyes , and i see eyes , and in the head of my audience , the <unk> of
when i think that it 's a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> music is , then , it 's about these <unk> <unk> pictures of old people who are in the same time , and in the very short world , and very much of the art .
frank <unk> said to music about music is like architecture .
and so similarly , what we do is what we do .
so , you 've got to get a little bit of what i 'm going to do , i 'm going to show you a short film .
film .
it 's the <unk> <unk> .
this is what it looks like to the point of my view .
since the more time , it 's more important to be the value of the work , which is something else to do something else .
we 're now <unk> today , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and we 've been very early in our youth , which was incredible and joy of music .
but we also have that the consumer of the consumer and the department of the government , and we have some joy , well , a little bit of work .
and we 're the belief that the theory of the classic music is not about the content , so the music itself is , but it 's not in its own .
so we ask ourselves , how can we create a more <unk> that that music is going to be able to be the friends and the power of the power that we 're like to do .
how can we organize a consumer system that has to be the consumer of the consumer ?
we think the parameters that you 're looking at the classic concert , space , , , , , in the question , basically , in the question .
let 's take the relationship between the audience and musicians .
usually there 's the stage between the stage and the audience .
we 're trying to make the <unk> .
here 's a picture of our <unk> .
the musician sit in the audience , drink beer , and you 're talking about the audience , with the audience , two pieces , and you 're going to go back in the audience .
that 's the whole time in the evening .
everybody who 's got to be on the stage , and then it 's coming back .
or that 's the <unk> .
the classic concert is that you 're going to be more comfortable or less comfortable , and you 're like , like you see , and look at the next thing .
there 's no music , you ca n't even sit on .
and we 've got to think about how you can do it .
if you sit in a little bit of , you can be able to get a little bit of music , and then you can hear it differently .
so that 's not that we 're going to do this concert , but four stages of the audience .
the audience was really interested in the audience .
so i was sitting in the first row of the first row .
important for us , we 're not just just making a lot of a kind of thing , but we 're thinking about the music of the music .
so we 're asking what the spaces and <unk> <unk> and the other people are going to be the music that you can do , and how they do it ?
and so , in the way , you see , at least , at least , at least , at least , the most <unk> year in the morning , the most likely to be in the most <unk> , in the most <unk> , in <unk> , in
but not only the spaces and the lighting can be music and the lighting , but also the connection with others .
and so we 're totally happy that we 've been working for a few years with the work with the <unk> , and to make the <unk> of the <unk> , which is not the <unk> of the <unk> .
and so , that 's what we 're going to get to the same , or for the <unk> of the <unk> , or for the <unk> of steve rich .
and in this year , we have a little bit of that , if you want to be a little bit .
we have to first have a concert with a <unk> .
we have the story of the soldiers of the soldiers with <unk> , and <unk> , and it 's to be a private interest .
that 's because it worked because we had a big opportunity to have this piece of <unk> .
we 've got a lot of money from the people that we had to be able to put it in the public .
and this is what 's called a community that 's coming from a community .
we 're totally happy in the near <unk> of the <unk> in the city .
the city is that the big big thing that we 're great to make great spaces and exciting places for a good way , but also small , that we can recognize .
when the first year in the spring , two weeks ago , the <unk> of europe is in the city , and it 's just that the city is going to be more than the <unk> people in the city .
the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we 're <unk> a <unk> mixture of students and students , who have to be more , but completely completely completely remixable .
and for a moment , for a grant , that 's the quality of the security or coordination and funding , for the eye , for the <unk> , for the <unk> , for a year , for a year , for a year for a long time .
but also , but they 're also looking for the year for the year that for example , or the quality of the election , the <unk> , and the <unk> is to be <unk> .
we 're all in our lives and lives in germany .
this is the biggest part of the work , and in a <unk> .
only three times in the year we 're going to talk about the year with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a little bit of the problems that are coming up , and also the ability to make the difference that it 's really important , if you want
for the <unk> , i will have 30 to 30 volunteers , who would be a few days or a few weeks ago , and they can get the hands of the help , and where they need to be paying to be better , for the highest time
and of course , in these 14 days , the musicians are going to be .
now , you could have to be able to have anything that you need to be a <unk> .
but our more <unk> is still going to continue .
we 've been in the city in the city of a big community around us to create the way we want to do what we want .
this is the classic <unk> , but also , but about the same thing , as the example , we have a baker , that 's a baker that has to be a baker , and for the <unk> , we need to make fresh food .
this is a <unk> in a <unk> city in the city , and it 's sold for the whole year .
and to go to the past .
we have a whole bunch of <unk> in the world that we have to make their living in the way that we can get the musicians .
and this kind of way is the <unk> of this city and the people in this city .
they 're looking at a very special way that 's happening .
since the year we were able to get to support the citizens of the citizens , the citizens in the world , which is all a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> .
we 're <unk> of the <unk> , that classical music is , and it 's going to be the right hands .
so we 're incredibly happy about that in europe , and then a lot of music on their own hand , and home in the cities .
if you do n't have to be able to imagine how to be , like this , the music music is going to experience , you 're just going to be just over .
so we 're going to go back to the next year , and we would be going to be going to be going to be there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen .
you may think you might be going to be able to be able to know .
you know , learning to learn to learn to learn to learn , but i mean , i 've been going to learn to learn more much more than much more , and more importantly , and the <unk> .
you know , i think , a great formula for the moment .
what i learned from art and culture , i can have a lot of of course , because it 's <unk> , i 'm going to be in this field .
and so i thought that it might be really , that it 's something that 's going to be a little bit more important to give me what my talk is .
art is beautiful , but a lot of work .
they 're also laughing .
you 'll see laughter , though , most of the most familiar , you know , the most familiar thing .
why is that ?
i think that 's what we do to do that in the word , which is not what we can do .
art , that 's what we 're doing .
and the work is , we 're going to tell you what 's happening .
sometimes .
people who work to work , which is what i do .
but in work , we think about the <unk> and the art of the art is more than the realm of life , where we 're moving into our experiences , our experiences , our own ideas .
and so i 've got my implications to you , i want to tell you about three hours in five different parts of the <unk> , which is the <unk> , i just start with it .
it starts with the moment that the childhood 's starting to be on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not going to tell you my youth , not a worry , and then i 'm going to tell you the word , i 've been going
the interaction for the first part of my life and then , five , negative , identification .
and you 're going to be able to be able to get this pieces of <unk> <unk> .
and it 's two , two and more .
you learn that in the first two years , three years , when you get a <unk> , and i 've been a <unk> .
and so , with 10 , 11 , i 've got these little pieces of pieces , on the piano , not far from the <unk> , at home .
these pieces of life is a <unk> .
it 's a tune and the other voice , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is , but it 's more .
and this , ladies and gentlemen , is something that 's really important to be , and if it 's only two voices , we can start to think , if the present , the future , the future , the past , the past , in the past
and i learned to have two , two , three , three , more than the same time , but to play , but you know , the one that is not going to do , the other ones .
that was what i learned , and i 've learned something else .
another experience i never forget , and i 've been worried that it might be so much .
i have a piano , there was more people in the room than today , and in the middle of the room , i came out .
i had forgotten .
i 've played it .
so again , again , and the same thing i did n't know .
the audience has more than i was , because i went to all my place , my notes , and i started to go back and started the third time .
and they do n't believe what i 've been doing .
but this was a very difficult experience .
perhaps , i was also able to experience the experience of what i knew , but i knew that i was going to be a little bit of , because i could n't be able to get my life , because you can talk about it .
yes , the next chapter i 've been working with my adolescence was i studied with inspiration and i want to tell you stories .
when i was so , i was going to be my clients , and i said , `` i want to be a <unk> , i want to be a better game .
and he said , `` well , that 's not .
because you have to have a lot of <unk> , and a lot of women have been done with women .
now imagine a young boy , so , young , so a sentence .
i did n't forget that .
and i 've been able to have more <unk> .
i was at the way to go to a <unk> .
i 've been hearing , i remember , i remember a situation that i never saw .
it was the <unk> of <unk> from <unk> and now i 'm going to work with the part of the work , i just did n't have it , and she was the most beautiful thing , the most big thing , and then then the ones , and
i ca n't play it , not a piano , and i could n't have it anymore .
i 've been going to have this 30 , 30 times a little bit of time and suddenly , and suddenly they were right .
and then i 've been on and i 've been playing and i 've been thinking i was a feeling of myself , and i know i 'm still going to go on the floor and laughed .
i was except .
i had nothing to do , nothing , and the music that i did with me .
one experience where i learned , emotions , really <unk> .
and sometimes it 's really hard to work in this country , in this condition , i call it the idea of the time .
where all of us is .
we had this situation in the middle of the world in a organization .
and then it was almost almost like the self , when we did the first , it took a little months for a long time , where you would take a year and for a half years .
now , that was my experiences with the piano , with artistic , with a little bit of work .
and i 'm going to come up with my <unk> , a <unk> .
i was first as a musician , but it was as a <unk> .
we have <unk> , and it 's more important .
i 've been given to me , and i 've got to be so much my attention to my music and i had to be able to be able to get the music .
in choir , i sing , a little bit , a little bit , wonderful experiences that i 've been very lucky to have .
and then i came to a point where i was a student in the theater , which was in the <unk> , and the <unk> , and i 've been working with this , and i 've been able to have this chapter , because this was the idea
and the art of the art is to make the world to my own .
so here 's work for art , but not as artists , but i would n't say you would n't say , but it 's not to be more than the <unk> and the other thing .
i was in theater and i 've been interested in germany , there was no longer a <unk> for the <unk> , in vienna , and i was <unk> , and i 've been able to do it with this question , so what can you do to make
and that was why i 'm going to spend my career in my career , and i 've been working in my career , and i 've been working with the first time i was .
but before it was a different , and this phase , i 've been working with interaction with interaction .
i was the germans .
the german quality has been its private interest .
i 'm still afraid , although sometimes i was in my <unk> , because i was born in my <unk> , because i was still the <unk> , that i 've got to get married , i 've got to get it to the moment .
but i 've got a <unk> root , because my grandparents were high , and i have been working in the <unk> , and i 've been able to have the <unk> .
that was me that i was n't really interested in the way i 've been doing , and suddenly i was in a different form of culture , in a culture , which has been been in a culture that has been been in this room in this room
once the <unk> <unk> , we were all in a different situation , in other states .
and i 've been working with the future , and i 've been working on the future , and i 've got to be married , and my friend and colleague , we 've got to work for the last night , he was playing with a <unk> ,
we 've got to have the interest , but of course , of course , we 've been working on the <unk> of the three months , months .
and this <unk> , that was really coming out of people .
it was my destiny that i was at ninth grade , and i did n't have to work with the wall that the wall was .
i was going to go on the next day , i had to go to the <unk> , oh , the wall , yes , yes .
i 've been waiting for me to be prepared for any questions .
and i was a lot of the cities in the middle of the east .
and i 've seen how interaction as interaction between two german cultures .
so , we 're talking about the same language that music is going to be wonderful and wonderful , but a lot of it , but it was more important .
unlike the <unk> , it was n't all of the people , but it was a lot of top , and that 's a big thing that i think , as the german identity , i 'll come back to the time , and the german
since germany , germany is .
since the <unk> , it 's also a lot of <unk> .
interaction , i 've been able to have all of these things and i 've seen the city in the city .
we 've been looking at this , i had to be a bit of the time that i 've been looking at this time , and i started to see it in my career , and i was working on the <unk> of culture .
i 've got the problem .
and so , for the time , you wanted to do it , you wanted to write it for the culture of culture and <unk> .
i was the first one of the first <unk> .
so i do n't have so much so much , but i was that that i had to be able to be able to do this , but she was soon because i was going to be education in education and education and education .
we 've been very much for the urban development , we 've got the same time that we 've been looking at the <unk> between the <unk> , and the more we see what we 've been doing is that we 've been able to experience the <unk> of
many of them could be able to build and i could and i 've been able to see what that means , if you can connect different people from different areas .
you know , that i 've always been more interested in the art of art , more than the culture that we 're talking about , the <unk> between people who are in cultures , and in the way i 'm going to take the <unk> and then come
interaction was also the idea of the time , and when we had to pay the idea , we had to be <unk> , the idea of the idea , that was the first year , the <unk> market was to work on the market .
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter has ever been the <unk> .
this word is two meanings , which i 'm a <unk> , i 'm going to give me something , and i can use it as a verb , and i can say , `` i know , i know something that i know .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , `` i 'm going to be <unk> or the community .
and i 'm thinking about something i want to say , and i 'm going to tell you that i 'm going to tell me what i 'm trying to do with me .
and this is a very big action .
five point three million people trying to move to the <unk> , to identify the way to identify the <unk> , and realize that you 're a community in europe .
as big , we 've been going to be <unk> , but as a community of many people who are in a big life , and yet at least a common language , if you have to be more , and this is our ability to unleash the people
in the <unk> , the highway , a lot of other things .
one experience of the past , not many people have been touched .
and there 's the <unk> , and for the two schools , two schools , young girls , who 's <unk> , and young students from school , and they have to be married , and they have to be <unk> , `` <unk> , '' , the last
and it was a special effect that young girls had heard of young <unk> , and young russians , the letters of young men in germany in the <unk> .
and there was a young men on piano and playing with this , i loved that .
and then , he said , `` he said , he said , `` i 'm going to be a <unk> , he said , he was home when young german , he was playing , and i can never have more than my two fingers . ''
and he had to be his finger with a <unk> , and he was playing on the piano in this game , and he was trying to play the <unk> .
and it did n't have it .
it was for me to be a <unk> scene that i was looking at the first time , and i said , `` what did we learn ?
we learned that we 've learned that many people can move together , but we 've learned that we 've learned that we 've learned that we 've been able to live in the middle of peace in peace and culture and culture that we 're not going to
and this was a wonderful experience , and you see it 's not just about something that 's about something .
it 's about learning to learn something about and win .
and if we do a lot of <unk> and invention , we 'll be able to let us explore ourselves and culture , our own position to work in the context of the work , when we interact with our own identity , and we also have to share
and i hope that you 've been still more successful and more than they have to make this profit .
thank you .
yeah , thank you .
i think we 're going to wait for the first picture .
so i 've got to support my memory for the first few slides .
but there are not a scientific slides , but it 's going to be in my career , and i 'm going to find a way to find a topic where i think that 's going to be the next few years .
by the words , i know , i know , thank you , thank you , i think , i think , i think , in the case , i think , in the case , we can be able to be able to see this talk .
and then i heard that you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you think , if you do n't know , if you look at it , you would n't understand what i was going to say , i did
how we die .
i need to tell you about the first time .
and the hospital was the hospital in the hospital that i had to be the most successful , and it was .
she was about the <unk> years old , and it was like to be in the old <unk> , because she was the first man , the first man was the first man in war .
and so , you 've got every year for the first year , and it was a long time , and probably a lot of time , and you have a lot of time , and then it 's going to be the right side , and it 's
a few years ago , they 've been still looking at the same way , and then the same thing , the left is broken .
and then i was also as a doctor and i 've been wondering how she was in the icu , how they were treated with antibiotics , and i was a lot of the discussion , and the discussion was how said , `` it 's really important to
power is all of the way to make a old people like this , and this is how to make this <unk> possible ?
so , the <unk> , for the time , in the care of the day , is a people who 's going to be a person who 's going to be a person ?
and they 've been cured .
five years later , i 'll get the clinic , and i can see the name of the <unk> , and i can tell you that because he 's just not seen , but it 's also the time that the <unk> and the <unk> was the same <unk>
so what 's the question is , what i 'm talking about is what i 'm talking about , when i talk about how a person is to decide what he 's going to be in his <unk> , or what he 's going to do with the <unk>
and this is a little bit of the theme of the presentation .
you see the <unk> of the <unk> , how we die .
it 's a book from the <unk> , how we 're working on the <unk> of the <unk> .
and then it was so strong that globalization was so strong so so they asked it to be how to work , and how to work ?
you 've got , and then you can read this book , and you 've been going to say that it 's going to be a <unk> , so that 's going to be the parts of the pieces .
it will be a <unk> of work , which is also going to be more much more more than the <unk> , for example , for china , that was a big issue .
and that 's also that that 's basically the work of the individual , something that 's something that 's been being used to be a <unk> , which is still the quality of the quality of the quality , which is the quality of the <unk> .
and that 's what i think that people are always aware of their work and more than much of the <unk> , and it was more important to be the way that it was to be more difficult to achieve the way it was to be more important ,
and if we 're going to go on the past and medical medical , there 's a lot of this kind of development .
if you hear the television , what doctors do , and also , i want to say , and also , what 's the most important , they 're going to be the so-called <unk> .
and that 's nothing else , when you have to be done , what you 've done is that it 's not going to be paid for it , and if it 's not done , the medical service is going to be the medical service , or for
and through this piece of information , but the work has always been more important and more more than the idea that you 've been doing it with the work and with the <unk> of personal faith , in the background , in the background , and it 's
a good friend of mine is to <unk> , because he did n't have to have a <unk> , who had been a <unk> , and he went to <unk> to the doctor .
the most important thing is that the most important thing is that the <unk> of the <unk> and he said , `` it 's been the <unk> , '' that it was always more old people who had to go back to the hospital , and then they had
then the hospital will be in the hospital , and they 're going to go back to the senior house , or <unk> , and they 're going to go to the <unk> .
and this family had been thinking about how it 's like a <unk> <unk> , and then i want to be able to do it to be a little bit of that that is going to be able to make this cycle of the <unk> of the <unk> and
now , in <unk> , he had to find it , after he had a lot of work that he had learned that the same thing happened to this .
it will also be used to die in the more than a product .
it 's not more the the the the <unk> , but you 're going to put it in a certain way , i 'm not going to be a <unk> , or not in the hospital , when i 'm in the hospital .
and then it 's going to be the <unk> .
in <unk> , it 's like the third days of a conversation with the <unk> , and you have to go to the hospital , i want to go to the hospital or i want to do it in the hospital when i was something .
so , i want to be going to be going to be going to be a <unk> , or i want to be a <unk> .
this data is going to go into a central center and there 's a physician for the moment , and then the decision is going to be the decision and then the decision on this basis .
if we think about the moment , the idea might be in the early <unk> , and even once , and imagine that the idea was a <unk> , i would n't have to be <unk> , and then you would have to be able to be able to
and this is my friend , who 's in <unk> , and also much more much as he wants to be doing it .
in the last thing that it 's so much about today , about 70 percent of people are not going to die in the same , but in hospitals , and that 's the <unk> , and that 's also the way that you can do that , and
there are a <unk> that 's very good , there 's a lot of people who are looking at , but when i look at the top , and we have to have the more patients in the year , so , for five years , , i would
and the whole thing of course is , it 's all of the reasons that it 's all of these things , that 's not the <unk> , because the last thing that is not enough to be , and that 's the most people are going to be
this is not the reality , but you need two salaries in the same time and and most of it , but it 's just just about it .
this is the <unk> of the quality of the system as a growing market , which is so to be able to do the same thing that you can do .
and now i 'm going to be able to figure out how you can get out of the way , so what we 've been going to do is , because i 've got to ask the first questions , and that 's just that simple , not the
and i 've got to just get the same time and the article for me , because i think , a society has always been creating structures , and the structures that we 've got to do in our society .
and in the fact , the one is that the people is going to be <unk> .
and the second sentence is that they 're going to protect the <unk> of all the time .
and what i 'm sometimes missing is that a third sentence in that , which is all the one of the funding should be to protect their dignity .
because this is a way to be looking at this case , i 'll give you the other way , and i would have to be thinking about a little bit and and then i do n't have to do it , and i do n't want to do
because in the last case , it 's still , if we do n't want to ask this topic , we 'll get to the point .
hopefully , until you have to be a hundred , or more , you know , it 's going to be a little bit better .
and that 's what 's going to be my job , and i say , `` i want to be a lot of time , but i want to be a lot of time , but i 'm going to be thinking about the topic , and if you
if you think about what makes it , you 'll get to get points to the bottom , where are the five most important things in my life ?
there 's a book that 's pretty <unk> .
it 's the self-esteem of course , it 's the friends that i 've been talking about with me and i can talk about the life that i 've been talking about and the life of the life .
it 's certainly the trust between people who might have to do with you , or in the case or a pastor or a or or a <unk> or other people who are involved with me .
and there are there there are many of the factors that i 've been going to do , and i 'm not going to do all of them .
but if you look at these three points , you 've been looking at a whole lot of tasks , how you might have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to protect the last two .
and then then another factor that we have a certain dictatorship of the experience , i think , as a text as as as as as a example of the time .
other people can make decisions for us and this behavior that does n't have to meet .
this is my inner belief .
our way we can just come out of ourselves .
so it 's not the question , what will be going to do for me , who will be for me , for me , for me , for me , who is to me ?
but it 's the way to ask , where i can ask people where i can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get this questions and can be able to explore and can .
and if you say , how we 're working on , these are these <unk> that we 've been looking at the outside of the <unk> , it 's a possibility to say , i think , i think my inner <unk> would be a <unk> mechanism .
because no person can be able to see me , as i can see myself , and the <unk> .
and i have n't have to be in general , or opinions , and you say , you have to have a <unk> <unk> , and because you 're so old , you 're going to be going to be going to be going to be a <unk> person
and these questions that i can just have to be in the last few years , and i 've been able to have a lot of it .
this would be a sense of the people who 's in me and not the outside of the world , who ca n't protect the state , and also , that i can not have the ability to be more and more than i 've been thinking about the
and to do this , you need to go , and it 's just the way , and i think i 've been talking about this talk , and here 's how the <unk> is like the food , that 's the way that i 've been trying to
so we can say , if we can be old , you can say , `` well , yeah , so , well , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , i mean , maybe the very high age of that , that would be the
thank you .
beautiful good evening .
i 'm going to give two things with it .
if you 're the first part of you , you 're going to be a little bit more <unk> .
it 's another second .
let 's start with the infinite <unk> .
this is stupid , not , it can take it .
what do you mean ?
there 's different ?
or is it infinitely enough ?
yeah !
this is not good , if you 're a bit of this , what 's happening ?
so , i mean , but i 'm going to take it out of the time that you know .
that 's exactly what we do n't do .
we 're just just with one single one .
and i 'm going to do this one little bit of the <unk> .
in the world , we know , we know , we 're going to take a knowledge of ourselves .
and it 's about the value of the <unk> of the size of the <unk> .
if we 're in the <unk> , and two two , you have to be in a <unk> , in the other people .
we know , well , we know , we 're looking at the box in the box , which is small , three <unk> , and it 's three people .
we can see it , if you 're all the same number of elements in it ?
how would we do it ?
that means , we would just be the people , one , two , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three .
that 's what you do ?
very nice .
this works in a wonderful wonderful work , which works with big numbers , even though it 's <unk> .
but it 's true .
how can you count it ?
how can you get that many people like chairs ?
i 've been aware of <unk> , and people did n't know what else .
so , let 's go .
you 're called the mate !
you know , that 's not , we 're going to be able to do the day and all of the things that all of it .
not that 's very beautiful .
so , you 're going to be a <unk> , and it 's just like , yes , it 's just a lot of it ?
you take a chair , you put it on a chair .
so the next thing , the next thing , the next thing , everything , all , different people , <unk> , no chair , and the size of the small , and the amount of big , right ?
now we go into the infinite .
how can we do two infinite things ?
we would say that it 's a big or bigger or smaller than others .
we could do it ?
we would start again .
right , that 's wrong because the point is when you 're going to get a lot of time , and you know , i would just say , you 're not going to be able to do it .
in the world , infinitely , it 's clear , right ?
so how do it go ?
<unk> ?
no , <unk> !
they had the right thing .
mate !
so , let 's look at this time .
appreciate that , it 's always bad , yes ?
you see you see , you ca n't see a end , yes ?
the point is , you 're just just simple .
if i take the first , you know , the natural numbers , we have to start with the zero , zero , two , two , three , four , five .
and we would say , `` we have a copy of this , and this is the <unk> of the <unk> of the number of numbers .
so , the only time you 're going to pay up , okay , zero , two , four , eight , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all the straight numbers are now the <unk> of the <unk> of the planet , but the one is the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the right , the <unk> , and the right , right ?
now , we call the number of numbers of the numbers , we call the other amount of <unk> of the natural numbers .
what do you think ?
is it more powerful , it 's bigger than the <unk> , right ?
right ?
but it 's very , very well , yes , in the case , there 's no problem .
who are another estimate ?
little ?
who 's a little bit bigger ?
ah , the really did n't have a plan , yes ?
ca n't be true , yes ?
you ca n't do what 's missing , which is not , that 's not going to be on ?
okay , you 're going to say that ?
would you think that ?
this is the popular thing that you 're supposed to be wrong .
and now i 'm going to tell you why the number are .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the straight amount of the <unk> , we take the zero of the natural amount of <unk> , and they 're looking out .
the next one , after two , two two , two , after zero , and i 'll get a more <unk> .
the four , two , the six , three , the three , the four , yes ?
you can also change it , then it 's going to be clear , right ?
and it 's totally clear that we 're going to make it , and that 's what i 'm going to do with the challenge of the challenge .
and here 's one , there 's just the straight switch , and the band is just the same , yes ?
we have the natural <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the band is still the same time .
that 's just the <unk> .
so if you tell some of you , what we 've learned today is , `` what 's going to be , '' because , what is it going to be , but i know , i know ?
a infinite amount of property is that there 's a property that 's not in the scale , and this is an absolute amount of <unk> , a real subset of the size of the size .
that do n't do that in the game , if you three three people two people , it 's just one of them , and it 's three .
yes , we have to make it <unk> .
is n't any of the <unk> ?
okay .
then we 're going to make a second part of the probability .
the professionals , the most important probability .
and here 's what i 've got to do .
so in this experiment , i 'm sure that 's at least a third , and it 's a little bit of the <unk> that you have , right ?
so , we call the doors , b , c .
i 've got behind anything , i hope you 've never heard it .
and you should have to guess what .
where i mean , i have something , you know , a b , b , c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate it .
who has another idea ?
a ?
who has a idea ?
i mean , you have , , you know , it 's not , you know , never , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
so it 's right .
it 's really completely not really , not to do my first letter , and i 'm looking for me .
it 's really no matter , yeah ?
it 's totally obvious because the chance that they 're lucky , it 's just a third .
in fact , there 's three things , it 's really no matter , yes ?
now i 'm going to do this . i 'm going to do it .
well , i know , where it 's .
and that 's what you 've got to be here , in the middle of this .
so i know , where it 's , and what 's going to be , and you know , it 's going to be a second round .
so i 'm really going to tell you the game i 'm going to do now now .
so it 's so , we 're going to go into a second .
now , i think i 'm going to be thinking about this , a <unk> ?
so , i have to show you a door , behind the fact that it 's not , and they 're not told .
because if you go to b , i say , and i know , it 's not a <unk> .
then there 's no second .
i say , `` i 'm going to say , the mouse , i had to be hurt .
but i have to say , that 's the <unk> .
so i can just just give you a <unk> , not not not yet , but what they did n't have .
now , the question is , and that 's the kind of probability of the condition that there 's one condition , which is the condition that has open , and it 's not enough to have it , you have to have the last chance to guess .
you can stay on a stick , then i 'm going to make a lot of it .
i do n't want to show you what you want .
or you say , i 'm going to do c .
now , now , the moment is that it 's going to be more likely to be more likely to be ?
it 's very beautiful , b , i know , it 's a little bit about c .
or but , god is that it 's been open , i wanted to stay in a stay that it 's .
or you would say , but it 's still , we have to have , we have to have two doors , but it 's not going to be trying to stay or stay .
what do you mean ?
it 's not no matter .
and it 's true .
why do n't it matter ?
very nice .
why is it that it 's ?
yes , exactly that 's wrong .
that 's almost almost if we were going to have yesterday , right ?
but so they 're , in fact , there are a new no , fun .
so , the thing that is really , is , yes .
and that 's all of the things that i do n't know , and i do n't know , i ca n't have to be able to do it , but i ca n't have to be able to do it in the past , and i 'm going
so , it 's all of the <unk> .
behind this door , it 's a third .
and it 's just a third behind a door .
you can guess what you want to do , you have two thirds of the <unk> .
that means , you can have two doors , not that you can do it in the same , you can have two dozen things , and you 're there , if you have the zero , there 's all right .
but here we have a door .
so , this is the two third of it is not what you do .
so , the two third , but it 's just just a door .
behind the right !
so what is it going to be more likely ?
i do n't have to be able to see it .
so what 's more likely ?
it 's better to stay , or do it go ?
now , it 's just right ?
yeah , of course !
so , that was n't hard , right ?
ha !
what do we see ?
they have been tough .
why ?
just just , two thirds are not a hundred percent of the difference between theory and practice .
i hope it was for everybody .
thank you .
mr. <unk> , you know , for jamie , who 's just the <unk> of diet , and bad food and people who are <unk> , that 's a <unk> .
but i 'm just going to be my best that that 's going to be all over the way , and that 's the result .
i come from the <unk> of the farm and i knew 12 , no mcdonald 's .
that 's what i think , right .
yes , yeah .
thank you for the minute .
i grew up in the near .
and i do n't know if you have to be on the <unk> , i thought , if i was at ted , i want to talk to the ted conference , and talk about a particular topic .
i 've got to tell me , i 've got to trust the issue .
so , i think motivation is not bad and i 've been paying me to tell me the woman who said , `` maybe , maybe , maybe a little bit of other things .
i 've been working on this .
so i would go to the bottom of the prison , but i would have to go to a lot of time , but i need to go to the <unk> , because i spent three weeks in three weeks , for three years , to go to the
so i 'm going to do it in the rain of the rain , not <unk> .
so , the next commandment , you want to be , `` <unk> , '' morning , in the morning , i 'm going to get you all a little bit .
i 've been told , i 've been told , i 've been going to say , i 've been going to talk about the topic of the issue .
and i started to start with the theme of the issue .
no worry , the beautiful , <unk> , blind trust , the blind .
i 've been thinking about it before i 'm going to be a little bit about how i 'm going to be going to be honest , how i 'm going to do the best i am ?
so , i come out of the village with six houses , and i have a lot of interest , and in my parents , on the farm , you have apple <unk> , and and you know , and what you need to do is , you know
trust , in sports , not in the most important , but i 'm going to talk about it , and beer .
why tell me the story where i am coming from ?
for me , one of the important stories that i really really have to do is the country from the village , and there was two great brothers who are talking about the oldest brother , the <unk> .
and with the second brother , the most blind thing is like i .
it 's the dark , and dark , as i can see , where the space is in space , whether it 's light or it 's .
what today is very convenient for the <unk> .
and we can see , if we can see something that 's happening .
but the <unk> , but i 'm not going to tell you , is the <unk> of the <unk> .
the theme of the old men , in the world .
and it 's going to go back to this <unk> .
and what i think was really important , it 's the fact that the fact that you trust , and you 're going to understand this great trust that we need to need to all need to be more than a little situation , but i think it 's
and that was for my parents , because they were like many of them , and i did n't have a blind knew .
we were so the first ones that we 're going to be relatively successful in their lives .
and then they had to do the situation of what 's going to do .
and i 'm now , it 's a great happiness that my parents had not been able to get the day of the day and to stand up with the hand , and you 're going to say , `` there 's a great happiness , you can go
a way that we 've been doing , we have to be a little bit of the <unk> .
and b <unk> our parents from beginning to be to be able to go to the way that our <unk> brother .
so , in the house , the <unk> , the <unk> , and it 's also going to be able to do it .
there 's the blind brother i 've been working with three <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
the way i 'm going to do it today .
so this is the great brothers -- who are not only good for the ones for the same .
and our brothers and brothers and my brothers and i was <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , so all of the things that could do , `` all of the <unk> , '' for example , for example , for example .
and that 's the relationship with the <unk> with three years , and then we wanted to be -- michael and i .
and then , we started to start with more , as much as many children , today , today , with the <unk> of the <unk> , it 's all the time to be the private election .
and the idea is that we can be able to do that .
but we 've got to start with the first time , and we 've got to be on the other time .
and then the big question : how does you get ma ?
and how you do that trust , the trust of the parents that they 're going to go back to the <unk> and the other , and the other trust that we 're not going to go to the time .
and our solution was that we have a lot of our parents to tell us where we 're going to be the <unk> , where we 're going to be a car where we 're going to be there , where there are any more things , where they
and we had to be in the <unk> , but we also know that the other thing is going to hear .
and that can not be in the case , because it 's not all the way that it 's going to be there , because it 's not anything that you have .
but the first time you want to go down and put it in your bedroom or in your bedroom , and in the bedroom , they want to be able to be able to go .
can you try to be able to go to the tongue of the tongue , and they 're going to be able to find that people like bats are also as bats as bats .
so as the bats that you 're going to hear , you 're going to hear the same , but the <unk> is the same , because the sound is going to be different .
and that 's for me , trust , also , in the movement , always important .
but the more successful <unk> , and the security , i have to help me , and i have to help me a lot of the way to help me .
and i do n't think of the problems of the big difficulties and clear , but there 's no lot of accidents that have been a or other , there 's been a lot of course .
what i do n't have to do is i 'm not going to have a pictures of the time that i 've been very interested in a lot of our children .
and that 's the <unk> of our higher buildings on the <unk> .
i 've been saying , that 's the confidence that are growing up by a private diversity .
and i mean , i 'm very literally literally because i was a person who 's been working in the workforce and in the relationship with the science of the science , and i never have to be a thing that i 've never been like , and i
and i never saw it as well as a result .
but also , it 's also not to do that , that it 's not any of the same things that we can experience .
diversity is in the way of our strength to be the most important thing to know where i am , and where i can do my strengths and where i can really have my strengths to the whole ?
and our brother , again , michael and me , and they were on the house of the house .
so , i said , `` okay , we 're going to be <unk> .
there can be a few of the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the <unk> went away , michael and i 've heard that i 've been still going to have a little bit of the girl in the front of the girl : in the middle , i do n't know .
but last , who 's going to be down to the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think that 's the other ones , we are still the generation of young women , not .
and so i 'm still going to go back .
and then , the consequence that we had to get all three three , and the dad had to be <unk> with the <unk> , and even more , what he did is actually going to say .
because trust is then then then , then , if others have the internet .
so , so , the father said , `` god will help help help help help , but then , if you have a big deal , that 's a lot of us , who was afraid of <unk> , and the interest of the interest , i know
but it 's never happened .
he had to be able to get it to that , and he had to be slow to the <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> has been given .
and that was what i found for me , that we had this opportunity .
but clearly , no worry that it 's not a <unk> , not to make it more .
for me , the different difference that i 've been always interested in my life , and all of the interesting things .
and all of them were all of the time , because i could see , because i could see what i 'm going to do , what i mean is my <unk> .
so , i 've never been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
i never had to be the <unk> .
and i do n't want to go to the future .
i go to the bottom of the rain .
now , now , not about five degrees in the moment .
and in the case , it 's more than the <unk> .
but i always always feel that i 'm going to trust my strength in my strength that i 've been different to try to make a different difference .
as first for example , the first thing .
and that was for me , because there 's the coach who had been told us , and i said , `` ok , we have a little bit of children , but they 're going to give us a few blind children .
it 's actually good because there 's a little bit of you , you 're going to go on each other .
and then you see what the other power is .
and there was always my big trust , of course , if i have a competition for the competition , it 's difficult to be difficult , because it can be the other thing i do n't want to do .
so there 's just a way , and that 's the trust of my <unk> .
the other one is a foot in the front of the <unk> , let me go back to the <unk> , and then he 's back and the competition is , because it 's the full device .
i 'm not going to try it .
i had to think about it .
i think that 's all of the things that 's going to be more abstract .
and i did n't have to have a volunteer , or ?
in the middle .
it 's just a <unk> .
okay .
the next thing for me was for a lot of the school , and the next time i was going to work in the school , and i want to be the same time .
my parents were home or more , and they have to teach us as children .
but for me , i was always in the school , i 'm really important to do how much i can do , for the school , to do my excess energy ?
and then i had to make a chance to do the school .
and even though i thought it was all that it 's all about , because it 's all the way to be the <unk> , it 's the <unk> , i 'm going to be afraid .
i was going to be used -- i 'm not going to do it .
i said , `` well , i 'm going to go to the <unk> .
and then , the first thing , the first , you know , the big diversity of the <unk> , because you need to need it , you need to be <unk> , and it 's also a lot of <unk> , and it 's important to be a
and you have to have a lot of work in their work ?
it 's also the same thing .
you 'll just quickly get fast , if you 're going to make the full trust of your own technology .
if you trust the trust of the power -- so the power that you 're doing , you know , if you 're in the bad weather , the bad weather , you can also get the <unk> in the <unk> .
and if you also find in my case , you have trust the team .
because when i do n't know , it 's really , i 'm going to be <unk> of the <unk> .
and i never have to be like this -- i 've got to use the word -- my <unk> -- there 's just a -- i 've been doing this .
but do n't do it , we 're still going to repeat again .
and i 'm going to be just going to be just more easy .
and you 're going to do a one one of you , a little bit of you .
what i 'm going to do is that i 'm going to do the issue of the trust , that is the practice that i think the listener is just like it 's as much as you 're doing it , and with the <unk> of the <unk> .
and in the case , you have to be two points in the hand .
so , i mean , i do n't have to be able to be able to buy a hand , but i would be able to get my own self and even the <unk> .
not .
so i need to help me differently .
i 've got my job to me .
and the <unk> of the voice is the voice .
so , the way you need to do is really to do it .
and also that 's important for trust .
so the precision of communication , so in the u.s .
and the more important thing i want to tell you is that the moment i want to say , and i want to tell you , `` i 'm going to tell you the first time , and i 'm going to tell you , on the left ,
if he says , the left on 10 , the left , and when he says , `` the right , on 10 .
okay , all of all ?
and then , the problem is , because i need to go to the problem , because i need to go to it , and i 'm going to go to it , i know , i 'm not going to do it .
and for me , it 's really big , the important thing that when i 'm going to go to me , i really need to get really the really completely important to the time .
to say , it 's to say , he 's for me to make the tools that i can be able to be able to be able to be fast and in the same time than others , the same competition .
and that can just be just if i do this , but i can do that with two poor , i 'm going to be on a leg and i have to do the eyes -- ha ha -- or you can also go to it , but it
and you have to have to be able to go and have to be on the other leg and the same way , and you can be going to be able to be able to go to the other , but it 's really going to be honest .
and also with the big shoes .
yes , and that 's really important to me , when i 'm going to be interested in the first term , i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to tell you , '' because i was just just men , because i was just like
so , what does n't you know what he said .
so i 'm going to give you the way that the way to open the information on the open system .
and that 's how to be a little bit of it .
if somebody does n't know , i ca n't help me , but i 'm going to ask you , but i 'm going to say , well , i think you can have a <unk> , but you may have to be able to get the future of
or i need to be like you like to go out of the time , you know , as long as the mountain is , because when we have the first , you know , you know , you have to be going to be going to be over
and it 's just like the crazy thing , and the thing does n't hear it .
and there 's also a lot of time , i 've also been looking at the pilot , as it 's in the <unk> , and i 'm going to tell you that we 've got to say , `` we 've got two minutes to be , we
so that 's important for me , because it 's the first thing that has been really important to have .
i hear the <unk> , there are probably other , who are going to be driving the next generation ?
who 's more than the <unk> ?
so my best time was time , but it was in september april , and now , in april , i 've never been able to have been able to do it as much faster .
and in the <unk> , the <unk> is going to be in the moment .
and for me , as i said , i can just be able to be able to get my ears , and i 'm going to be open .
the other thing i 've just described is what he sees , and i think that 's my risks , perfect .
and this is for me to tell me a very important thing that i say , `` trust is not a training and not that <unk> .
so , the blind , so , the blind , not much , i 'm going to be honest .
because i 've been thinking that i had a little bit of the right , and the left was wrong .
and then it was in the competition that was bad because it 's going to be three feet .
and i 'm just three feet .
so , as i said , it was the time that it was , of course , it 's been <unk> .
i know , because the idea is , you have to have to have , so , we need to be more honest .
and i 'm going to tell you today , i 'm going to tell people that i say , `` the left , the other left .
so , the right , but unfortunately , unfortunately .
and it 's not much of the life .
but clearly , in the situation , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
and then , it 's also hard to be very challenging to the challenge .
but for me , as i said , `` i 'm going to trust the risks that i have to have the risks .
and i have to say , i 'm not going to say , i 'm not going to see a lot of the biggest , because i 'm going to be a lot of the risk of my risks .
so , i 'm going to be all of the right now .
the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and i 'm going to be the most important , but i 'm going to be the most important thing -- i 'm going to be the good pages .
and then you can be able to get that , if you 're going to be the trust .
and if you find somebody , you 've got to be a little bit of the same , as i need to do it .
and i 've been looking at the same goals .
because this is for me to be the next thing that 's going to be the next thing .
you need the same goal , and i really need to be clear , what is it going to do , but it 's also going to do it ?
because of the course , it 's often more efficient , which is the time you use .
i trust the or or myself .
but the very important thing is that it 's too much .
you know that you need to pay for trust .
and that 's because we 're going to be able to get people all of the time to be all of the best , we want to be able to see the truth .
and the sense of that is often often that we 're going to do the same thing to achieve .
we can do it -- in my case , for example , i 've been looking for a couple of weeks , i 've been waiting for the <unk> .
and i 'm going to say , i have to be looking at somebody who 's like i 'm going to be able to do that , and i 'm going to be able to do this mountain , so i 'm going to give you this mountain .
and how do you do that , you 're going to get the mountain at the bottom of the mountain ?
well , i had to be able to have the huge advantage , i have some things that do n't even see if you 're looking at a hundred meters .
then i was pretty much more <unk> .
can be more advantage , and it 's not a problem .
and i 've been still working with the fear of the <unk> , but i 've been going to have to be a lot of time , and i 've been going to have a lot of time to be in berlin , and i 've been going to
that 's all the time , if you go down , and you see the car , you have n't seen it , you have to do it , you know , it 's going to be hurt , if i 'm going to be honest .
and these things are always interesting .
but i also think to have to be able to do it , but i know , `` hey , i 'm going to be going to be the same thing , i 'm going to be able to focus on , and it 's also a new new
and that 's exactly the quality of the moment , because of the first mountain , because it 's the first time , you 're going to go to every day , and it 's just just just a little bit of it .
you 're going to go and just <unk> , and it 's still <unk> .
you need to be the <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> , the first time , the first world .
so if you look at the <unk> , it 's the last one of the last one .
the only thing that 's going to be the only exciting thing .
we have the <unk> only distance from the distance .
so , i mean , i 've been working in the same way to be in the case of the election , despite the best , despite the best , he had to be able to be able to do it .
because i thought , `` well , i think , i 've been going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to get the thing that you 've got to have .
but as i said , it 's otherwise , because you 're not going to get to the moment , because you 're not really much about change .
and really , it 's going to be a little bit difficult to be going to be difficult .
so if you go into the height of the air , it 's <unk> .
or if you go to a little bit , if you 're going to go down , you have to go down , and you know , the left is the left , and the right .
and then it 's especially beautiful and when it 's still , and all of it , and all of it , he 's going to be a little bit of <unk> , and he said , `` well , he would be going to take me to the
because i was only a single <unk> , and it was sometimes it was sometimes there .
trust , we 've created that i said , `` well , i can be my friend , my girlfriend , who was a <unk> , <unk> , i 've got to tell you that we 've got to be good .
but i also need to be able to do the same way that i 'm not going to focus on , because you can imagine if you 're looking at the mountain at the bottom , right on the right on one side , on 11 .
and it 's going to be a little bit of time , and it 's all of the time .
so for us , we 've been able to be able to be able to be able to connect the <unk> , so we put a wire on your backpack with the <unk> , and i was going to put it on the <unk> of the <unk> .
and in the other time , i had to be able to be able to get the little bit of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and she 's still just with the foot with the foot , and it 's got to be with her <unk> , and i 've been able to know that i was going to have a lot of that i was not going to focus on the way that
and what i really really really showed you is how it 's actually , when you 're looking at it , you 're going to see the top of the top , you know , you 've got to get this goal to the bottom , and it 's
but on the other hand , it 's also that i realized that i was that i 've been saying that i 'm going to be in the fact that i 'm not going to be the first time i 've been looking at the top .
but the trust is also also to be in other ways that the quality of trust works .
when we were at night , we were going to be the mountain of the <unk> , we were in the group of the most time and behind us , and there were the other seven people who were sitting on and the <unk> , and it was all
at night , you ca n't see the girls at the back of the back .
that 's not the reason it seems to be .
and then i realized , ah , yeah , yeah , that 's what your trust has been in your ability to be in the ability of the same time .
you 're going to go through the dark , you 're going to go back to 12 o'clock , and then we did n't have a light .
it 's totally hard when you 're going to be <unk> , the air is just just a little bit , and not even more , and not more than the first time .
and then , but then , the moment that you said , `` yes , '' you know , `` yeah , it 's really really true to go to you , because the friend of me has been told me , and we 've always been thinking about
and the whole night , and the other people who had been told , and the other group of the group was just like the <unk> , and it 's just the <unk> , it 's just the time that i told me .
or i did n't have to tell you what else does n't have to tell you .
and that 's what you know , it 's somebody who 's probably going to be just bad about it , but it 's just about the last time , the sun 's going to be soon .
so , these things that can see that this is the way that you can see the same , and can be able to make it that you can be able to do that for the most personal gold .
and for me , i 'm always going to be thinking , and it 's all of the time , if you 're going to be the personal gold gold , and what 's going to do , you know , it 's going to be a little bit
so , that 's obviously , in sports , in sports , in the sports , you know , i do n't know why it 's not going to be the <unk> , maybe i do n't know to be able to do it , but it 's just
so i 'm going to give you some of the <unk> , it 's like vancouver , there were six pounds .
if the whole thing is , i would n't have to be , i would n't have to be on the <unk> , i 'm going to be on the <unk> .
or at least , in the <unk> , it 's more <unk> .
but as i said , i think that 's the real thing that you can do , you can imagine , what i 've been doing in the fact , and how i 've got my ability to share and forces on the point .
so i 've been in my ability , but of course , the team we need to do , whether it 's in the work , in whatever it 's always .
no , whether old man or young woman , we need to do people , we can trust them .
and if we have this goal in the head of the head , and you 've got to have the best evidence that we 're at least in a project in our lives .
and if you can see it , you can definitely be safe in other areas .
thank you .
science is a science for me that 's the title of my talk , which is to be <unk> in the beautiful maps .
what i 'm going to do is that the most important effort that the science has been to be the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in the general population .
basically , i could be happy .
when i put a <unk> in a <unk> , there 's all the only literature for science , which is the norm .
even every single time has a range of time , and it 's <unk> , magazines , research , research , research , many things , that 's kind of <unk> .
everybody has to have a <unk> , where kind of <unk> science is going to be a lot of things .
even , that 's totally true , if you see what it 's doing , and i have to teach kids with kids with science .
every program has a <unk> <unk> in the moment , but yet it 's a true story .
science is one thing that i can like to read , but that 's not the most important thing i 'm not going to do .
cool , cool , is just just about the same , in the same , <unk> , <unk> , there are the chemist , so you 're going to be <unk> ?
at the same time , you have a little five minutes , not to do it with reality , but it 's cool , right ?
there 's what i can do .
big bang , i can see it , i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great .
this is extremely bad .
because that 's kind of a little paradox , the future will be going to be able to solve these technological problems and issues .
but the same thing is not even a way of itself .
i 've got some little examples of how science or science is just about a <unk> .
one of the most important example : in london , you have a beautiful tower , for the architect , the architect , not just as we just thought , we 're sort of like this .
what happens is that the sunlight of the <unk> is in the <unk> , i 've got the time , and then it 's going to be a <unk> , and then in the other hand , there 's a point of a point .
the big press was the press , because it 's just a jaguar .
so , the heat that it has to be that poor that it has been really long , for long , long , it 's the time that it 's the time .
so , there 's a architect , which is n't really a kind of thing that 's kind of a little bit of physics , because i mean , it 's completely new , that 's a mirror .
so what i found was , it 's a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , where he 's <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so i really wonder what 's the design of design or architect or where he did ?
this is a very <unk> example .
a classic thing that 's such as the current problem is , is the genetic level .
now , the genetic information is now a few years ago , as this kind of kind of media .
so , there was the <unk> , because it was <unk> , because it was a danger of the danger .
genes was <unk> with green .
genes were kind of bad .
in the <unk> , oh , there are genes .
there were situations where the market has been really <unk> , hey , i 've got to have a lot of vegetables .
no idea what that should be .
so , yes , okay , the <unk> tomatoes , we can discuss it .
but in the lab , i was in the lab , and i was really frustrated because i tried to have these bad genes in my bacteria , and that 's all the time .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my neighbor , , you know , you do n't know , what 's going to go ?
i mean , i 'm going to try to do three days in my bacteria and work that does n't work .
so that was what i tried to explain , so , kind of a <unk> , genes , i thought , `` well , i 'm good , if i 'm talking about genes , you know what you 're doing .
so that was what i really meant , so i was a certain sequence that i wanted to get in this room .
but that was what the woman has .
this woman never ever crossed the hand .
who knows what i want to do , you know ?
genes is what 's bad .
now , this is now now good for 10 years , and yet it has been the kind of consciousness .
genes , that 's what 's bad .
i 've been really quite much more reading .
it 's always going to be <unk> and <unk> , but it 's really in our language .
and for europe , it was a headline .
and the other species of other corn is not any genes .
another headline , they 're <unk> rats .
yes , this was a beautiful headline .
but the ones are not so old and it 's also quite much more important , which is what i 'm going to do .
no , whether the time or the picture , all of the things are coming from .
luckily , it 's not even more important to the late , but i 'm afraid that it 's not going to be more long .
but this shows what uncertainty is in the population , because they 're not just talking about the issues .
nevertheless , we need to be in our future of these technologies .
now , now , i was n't just the big thing , but it 's going to be the big thing , but it 's going to be about things and the most people who do n't have really really really really aware of .
and that 's pretty sad .
how does it actually be in the lab in the world ?
if we think that little , young , scientist scientists , he 's a experiment , and that 's a experiment , which is good , and it 's <unk> , and it 's really , what 's really important to do , but the public
and then you have to go to the professor .
the head , the <unk> , okay , <unk> , the name is , `` it 's always important in science , ''
good idea , i 'm not going to be in the public , it 's about a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> , oh , great idea , class , we have a press .
and so , we have a press project , a beautiful idea , and that comes out from the <unk> <unk> .
that 's going to be , but , but who 's actually ?
now , these are the <unk> <unk> , usually , a common <unk> , a common <unk> , a common <unk> .
and all of these will be the same , the really cool projects , which is about the <unk> of the magazine , which is the <unk> , whether it 's <unk> , or more , or more .
that 's the way .
and the ground is going to be on the <unk> , which is the <unk> , really cool experiments , which really really <unk> projects in these <unk> .
that 's a good <unk> magazine , which is really good , there 's all of the lesters , but who 's going to do that ?
basically , the thing that 's really interested in .
in the case , we 're going to call the most successful thing .
so , the way that you 've been interested in , the <unk> , the <unk> , and good , and good .
beautiful magazine , the audience who who think that you might think , and maybe you have to have a idea where it 's going to be in this papers .
who 's the most important thing i do with it ?
the most important thing that it 's going to do is that it 's happening .
the way that was , the <unk> <unk> , i call him the <unk> <unk> , who had to be the <unk> of the other people , i tried to do it , and i do n't have to do it .
but again , our future will be just going to be able to be able to do this with this .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , renewables , all the things that are all concerned about , the <unk> , the french , but not really understood and and that 's going to be the way to vote .
my project , my idea is , is , , that little young young young scientists , who are <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , to take all of their normal <unk> , and he would give a <unk> , like a <unk> ,
what 's happening is that a scientist i 've been a <unk> , and we know that we 've been talking about for 20 years , he 's a <unk> rule , it 's not a <unk> rule .
once he 's the mouth and he said , he 's a little bit of his <unk> .
in the fact , the scientists who tell us what 's going to be a bit of the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is almost almost the same level of genes .
<unk> , that 's kind of , you know , you know , you know , what 's going on .
and the really teaching , you know , it 's beautiful , and good if you 're sitting on a conference , and you give people to your people who want to tell you , but you can say , `` you 're going to tell you , but
where is the problem that really , and it 's really about the problem ?
so i 'm so , that 's my idea , these young scientists who are not so far in the hierarchy of the hierarchy , which is a little bit more malleable , which is the school i 'm going to do .
this is all of the same , as whatever , as whatever , you know , what 's going to be in the case of the election .
and ultimately , the money is going to be used to be the <unk> , which is actually the most important thing to communicate .
but the training , that 's just a story .
i want to be able to do it in a <unk> , and the next time you have to introduce a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , , , , , , not , , not , it 's not .
there 's a quote , i do n't know whether it 's the real idea of albert einstein : if you ca n't explain it , you ca n't really understand it .
so , the scientists of the lab and to make the project , how can i do that really ?
so , there 's a lot of <unk> .
but the most modern thing is , all of us , in all of the university , but also , but i just just just entered the same time .
who 's going to go to the end of the city in the university of a <unk> , and then a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ?
that 's what it 's going to be in .
i 've got to go back to my job .
so , these are people who are doing that , who are going to go to the moment and give you a little bit of time .
this is beautiful , because everyone 's all all of the <unk> are happy , all of us are happy , and that 's the <unk> .
so i 'm going to go to a second aspect of that , not to be this part of the project .
these scientists are also going to be able to do how children are children ?
because many of the really really important is to reduce the scale .
because scientists like the research , and how children have their world , is identical .
children work very much .
they 're doing something like that .
they try to figure out what does it work ?
and the <unk> , no , no , do n't work , but i change a lot of parameters , which is going to be a little bit more exciting .
children learn extremely scientific .
that 's really , , and more , i think , and i think , what happens to the factors that i have to change it , it 's not the way it works .
that 's normal !
but that 's a lot of the <unk> .
and so i think , really , that 's just the only thing that we 've been looking at , and these scientists are in the neighborhood in the neighborhood where the children are in the neighborhood , where they were in the school , where they were in
and then you may be perhaps , maybe that 's my hope , and then i 'll tell you the kids , and then i also give you the <unk> , but then i also have to tell you about scientific issues , because the kids tell him that
this is not somewhere in the newspaper , which is not somewhere in galileo , but his children tells him something that it has been working with a <unk> that has been a broken thing that has been a <unk> , and it 's also a <unk> , and
and not just i 'm going to get to the end of my <unk> , but also the best .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's just the first time that i 've got to say , `` i 've got to have , yes , , , so , , for our scientists , that 's not the same thing that we 've been doing .
a scientist has not communicate .
yes , i think i 'm going to go , okay , i 'll go to the next .
but who 's in a state of working , in a company , as you still , it 's the next step .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , it 's the question .
fly you can not have any day .
the last few weeks was terrible .
the weather has a big <unk> of the <unk> .
seven years ago , eight years ago , i 've been asked to be asked to be here .
i was <unk> , almost 10 years ago , in the retirement election , in the <unk> , and in the u.s .
we 're right now to come up .
and the first time is the customer .
and for me , it was really , that 's the same thing .
what should you do ?
and it 's actually ridiculous .
i 've seen it , but i know that 's what i 'm going to talk about today .
and yeah , it 's a little bit crazy , but it 's still a little bit too difficult .
it 's beautiful and always exciting , and it 's fun .
and i 'll just just tell you the next few minutes , <unk> minutes , a little bit of life .
i 'm <unk> in the u.s .
the company has been there for a hundred years and it 's a lot of years .
i 'm <unk> of the <unk> .
this company has been over 20 years .
and <unk> of the <unk> .
the company has been about for about 30 or <unk> .
the <unk> of the zeppelin is the <unk> .
<unk> .
so this is a picture that i want to show you , the little thing is that this is actually a red , which is a <unk> , or something , not exactly , exactly , exactly , that 's a big thing .
it 's the world 's only more important .
and it 's actually just about 10 active active .
that 's what 's happening .
there 's about 20 thousand <unk> in the world .
so that 's not a market .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is , why do you do that ?
how do it do that ?
and in fact , the only time , and only , in fact , we can have a lot of time , and we can talk about why it 's going to be so much about this .
it 's just short story .
and so , a lot of a lot of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
very short .
and it was until the first year , the first world was <unk> in the world .
then , in the first world , the world was <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , and we 've been working on the first year , for the first year .
the <unk> of the <unk> and so forth and so forth .
and as we went to <unk> and eight years , and with a great campaign to fly to the <unk> , the english newspapers was <unk> with the <unk> , but they 're not going to get bombs , but in the spirit of intent .
so this is the story of the story .
and we had a <unk> campaign .
but the customer , the customer , not , because he had a lot of , because there 's a little bit of what it was going to be there , the old memories of it .
and so , it was the <unk> for the marketing .
but yet , it was in london , in london , the weather in the north , there was a lot of years ago , very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not very much .
and then , it has been three , despite the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and it has a <unk> to be that america .
this is a myth that the whole german nation has been thinking about something that was more than the <unk> and the <unk> .
there was the new york in new york .
and the whole german nation is , we have to be <unk> .
this is in all the way that it 's in the room , and this is really the story that this is a little bit of this device .
but actually , it 's been until the first time , and only five , six , seven , seven , and actually , just two , the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
the passengers , a hundred , where it was going to be <unk> and three , and it was the end of the end of the day .
it was a myth .
and the first time then the first day , the first life is , unfortunately , unfortunately , it 's still the same .
next the titanic , the event , where a one of a <unk> , a product is never going to be a product .
and the other ones were working on .
and the last thing , the last few years , the last few years .
the materials that are used for the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
then it was n't about the <unk> of the years .
and then the <unk> had <unk> <unk> and zeppelin , the idea that the idea was , maybe you should start to start .
and i was <unk> , because you 've got a great product , we 've got to be able to do it , but the market .
yes , he 's a market ?
what 's there in this ?
so , that 's what i 'm doing .
so we 're talking about this .
the <unk> of the <unk> , that 's perhaps a little bit about that , we 're going to be a little bit of time , and there 's a lot of people that 's a lot of it .
there are many companies that are made from this <unk> .
it 's today today , for 20 billion dollars .
this is a real economy , right now .
there 's a lot of science .
and i 've been convinced that i 've been looking at this .
the zeppelin is actually a normal plane like any other plane , but it 's sorry , it 's a gas , <unk> , <unk> , and also a private quality .
it 's like a <unk> , the water in the water and there 's the <unk> .
the time is not there to explain the details .
in a <unk> , a zeppelin , it 's a structure of a structure .
there are two types of <unk> .
there are certainly the same , we 're going to be in the case , and we 're going to be in the case .
the ones that have n't have in the structure and the <unk> are like <unk> .
that 's most of the most successful world that has been built in the world , and over the world , over 20 years .
and there 's just as i said , `` i 've been just going to be just more <unk> , but it 's just about the two , just 20 years ago .
so , the production of the production is a <unk> <unk> .
the left is even more .
and the <unk> is also the way .
it 's coming from the <unk> .
<unk> : the <unk> of the astronauts .
and the <unk> is the origins of the origins .
costs one point to two million dollars a piece of a <unk> .
and it must be to be more important to be more , and must be more important , because you have to be more likely to be a hole , if you have a hole in a hole , it ca n't be on .
and so , the same thing we need to do is to make the more <unk> and look at the same way , if it 's going to be <unk> .
and the end of the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> as it 's .
so the zeppelin is actually a <unk> product .
and this is the bottom , you 're going to look at the numbers .
one point nine percent of nine percent , one of nine percent , one of the five percent of the <unk> is that the <unk> thousand thousand thousand dollars in the year .
this is very very very very good .
that 's a <unk> .
so , the can look at the way .
but there 's a other trend that 's going to be right now , and i 've got this here .
we had three years ago , three years ago , when i started to start five years ago , eight years ago , three percent of the year , three percent of the year , and three percent .
and this year , we were in the <unk> of the age .
if you have eight years , my eight years , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and you want to be able to say , `` you can tell you at least in this eight years , of course , that 's a very <unk> , that 's
we 're all right .
we ca n't fly through a <unk> fly .
the want to see something .
and the ones that are going to be more and more than the year , and the more time we 've been going to die .
so a little bit of our <unk> , that our weather is not just as well , but we 're going to make the weather , because we 're going to make the weather .
but because this is that is now the good story of the european program , almost 10 million dollars and we 're an essential part of this program .
i 'm going to go on the morning .
this is the <unk> , a flying lab .
it 's called the campaign .
and we 're going to go to the top of the earth and <unk> feet .
the <unk> is going to be <unk> .
and the zeppelin , the zeppelin , <unk> , in italy , in china , in the u.s .
many of many hundred years of <unk> , and the air is the air that you like , how they respond to our things that we do .
so , i just just demonstrated it , because we 're just going to start with the second .
a great job .
and if you want to be a way , you 're going to be the subject of the subject .
so that 's very good .
and here 's another <unk> .
that 's the <unk> last week week or week .
and in finland , the weather is great , <unk> , <unk> , 30 degrees centigrade .
the <unk> said that they never had .
i 've been just wonderful , beautiful , beautiful <unk> .
the mosquitos were n't bad .
we were in africa .
and for the <unk> , for the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> by the <unk> of millions of years .
only you can ask , it 's all africa , it 's a sense of a sense of thinking , if you ask yourself , for a idea , for a idea , it 's really important to think about the movies that the film has been , and
i 've got to ask me what we do ?
and what are we going to do ?
the end of the first two years , we were going to be done .
the <unk> went on .
the whole thing was the whole time , and the project was finished .
and a tornado <unk> the zeppelin was the <unk> of the <unk> , then the way he could stay on the bottom .
but not bad .
we had all good insurance and really really happy .
this was the prototype of the prototype .
and i did n't know what i should do .
yes , what we 're doing today is a very quick bit of the <unk> of the country .
what we do today is it 's about complexity , it 's about it , or it 's going to be about it .
what we 're doing today is the future of the future .
we do n't know of course .
we have to get the zeppelin .
it 's called <unk> .
there are still more , in the other , 10 , 15 years , they have to be treated .
we 're just going to replace the entire entire entire <unk> for five million dollars .
and there 's the clients that we 're talking about .
we do n't need to make the whole time .
we 're a <unk> <unk> , which is the germans , and the european government , and they 're always going to be talking about the <unk> , and as they also have to be <unk> .
that 's also the same and cost money and it will be still going to be going to be going to be getting more .
the question is : do you do it ?
so you want to do it ?
do you need more to be more important ?
it 's more <unk> , <unk> .
what does you do ?
so you 're going to go on the market ?
so you 're going to go on the business ?
and that 's what we 've been trying to do .
and there 's also a lot of <unk> .
how the way of the <unk> was the <unk> of the <unk> , and was a lot of <unk> .
the beginning on the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
the population of the german population has been saved by six million dollars as a dollar , and he was basically the <unk> , he was a <unk> <unk> .
and it 's all the time of the <unk> , and the other companies , we know , but i do n't have to do it , but i do n't have to have any other companies .
we were in tokyo ,
we were , and they 're going to hear the past , in san francisco , with a client .
it was a very powerful <unk> .
both projects are unfortunately failed .
so , it 's also the same .
we 've won the same time .
because i did n't have a picture because we ca n't have the <unk> of the <unk> .
but in america , the first of the first work is in the first election .
we 've got three pieces .
and with the same way we 're working with a partner with a partner , the technology is new .
and this is a big success , but the only thing is .
two clients are basically basically because it was not .
why did n't it ?
we know it 's actually .
either , the location of the right or the passengers had to be in the right or the <unk> , or in america , you know , the last 30 years of the year .
the <unk> people have been seen , and you 've seen this , `` oh , again , again , a <unk> , which is a <unk> .
there can n't be that you can do that .
and it was actually twice as much of marketing , hey , people call it , and it 's going to be <unk> .
and it 's good .
the pilot has to transport the year , and they need to be <unk> .
but last year we 've got to just have the weather .
there 's no one of a million .
that 's bad .
the zeppelin is <unk> <unk> .
it 's the sense of course , when i also <unk> a <unk> , and the <unk> and and all of them and and all , and we do n't know that , because it 's going to be a <unk> , and it 's going to be the
and we 're great .
and i 've always got to get it to the mistake that you think we 're going to think about .
you could still go to the more <unk> .
we have a more successful quality of the election and we 're going to be <unk> .
that 's not quite a very much thing .
we 're also doing advertising .
this is a project that <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> that we 've done with the island of the island .
but the more is a difficult market .
and you have to be more thinking , `` do you make the sense of the <unk> ? ''
we have a lot of ads , but the internet has changed the whole way to go to the beginning , because the whole thing is going to control .
the lowest is largely more important , because there 's only more important active in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one of the three , three , three , three , <unk> , <unk> .
so , it 's six of 10 .
that means we 're going to be able to use the market , if it 's a <unk> .
and hope , to be able to get a future of this .
and what 's the end of david scott , <unk> of the apollo 15 months , after his <unk> <unk> , and five , he said , `` the car the <unk> on the top of the door .
so , it 's pretty beautiful .
advertising is also a beautiful thing .
only do we do n't have a customer .
and we 're going to find it , we have a technological value .
we have to ask them .
that 's not been <unk> .
it 's been , and it 's <unk> .
so this is a <unk> pilot for you to get you .
and then there 's no way there 's not .
there 's also weird effect that can be easy to be difficult to control .
in every case , the situation is , the situation , the world , is not a market , so it 's not a market .
yet we 're going to go on .
it 's a icon of the region .
the force has to make the power .
they just just ask the question : what do we do ?
how much money we do in the world ?
what do we do for this ?
what is the form of that ?
and i personally thought , i 've been asked to say , i 'm going to tell you , i 'm going to tell you my story , where i wanted to be a <unk> , because i wanted to be a little bit of <unk> , and i
i was even in three years of three years , when i started to <unk> in vancouver island , and those all the <unk> results , i 've got me to tell me that i was doing this .
and then there was a <unk> about greenpeace that 's in the money , and they did n't know what they should do and just to be done .
and there 's me to be able to be able to do this .
and i 've spent three years of greenpeace , and i 'm going to do this in hope , a long future in the zeppelin .
zero , right ? <unk> , i 'm still ready , thank you .
and the <unk> is <unk> .
yeah , thank you .
these are my three points that i 've been going to talk to the <unk> .
why are we today in the world or in the abundance ?
how do we get a <unk> ?
and what do you do ?
what 's what it 's going to do ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part is a little bit about a little bit .
but it 's also going to be the challenges that we 're going to show .
a few years ago , it was a little bit more difficult to explain that .
we have a problem , every child .
we have environmental issues .
but it 's still time that 's going to be the challenges that 's population growth for example .
all sorts of all , it 's more important .
if you think it 's a historic long way , the oil will be going to be a very short episode of history in history .
now , we ca n't imagine that it 's kind of different than the oil will go back to the time .
you know the climate change the last year .
some say , well , there was more , we 've been going to have the last time to go back to the last year .
you can also see it , and i 'm going to be right .
you can say , who 's going to be the <unk> ?
you can say , the sea is far away .
but it 's also going to be a little bit more important to do it , and to make things that really , it 's really difficult to be in the way that we 're going to be in the health of the health .
it 's just about 30 degrees .
and there 's the level of our cities like in vienna or more , and more than it 's going to be bad .
but it 's also about the most important thing , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas where the big <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of it is to keep the himalayas from the himalayas .
it 's not the planet .
the planet is the best thing we do , there 's a lot of more big crises .
and a <unk> , but it 's about people who are in a different world , and in the world 's very uncomfortable .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts are coming .
the water is always less than the water .
this is the aral sea where a <unk> of our cotton <unk> .
and that 's where it comes out ?
these all bad things , let me tell you , in the one or other form of the global resources .
what we 're doing is what we 're doing in the earth , what we harvest .
not only that oil and <unk> and the minerals , but they also use renewables , but the only thing is going to be limited .
and we just just look at that we 're going to use how much as possible , to use the same time , and reduce emissions .
so it 's about that that 's been in the united states , which has been really dramatic to reduce the whole movement .
this is the challenge , not only , not only c , and two , a car to make a different difference in a different way .
different economies .
our technology completely new .
if we look at the same time , and <unk> , and there 's still the earth that 's in the world , which is basically a metric of the <unk> , a <unk> of the year , and the year .
in a moment , it was the longest time of human history , three tons of <unk> .
today , it 's 15 to the <unk> .
so , the <unk> has been to be the <unk> .
and he 's very <unk> around the earth .
it 's in america more than us more than the earth 's <unk> .
and in other parts of the world , you see africa , very much less .
and then we 're going to get the implications of the world , the rivers that the air has been much better in the last decades , but it 's basically that we have the other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world is still the same .
and so , the conflict we see , we see , in <unk> , , where you see , where you look at the <unk> of the american survey , and then you see where the materials are coming from .
and this is there , there 's all of these things , which is there , there are lots of resources where the world are going to be the world .
so if we want to go to the end , we need to talk to the issue of the issue .
so we have to change the ecological boundaries everywhere , all the time .
and what we 've been doing is that we 've been not going to have to have the capability of life .
this has been known by mahatma gandhi , as he said , the world has enough to be a <unk> , but not for everyone .
and there are we as we 're here in the average life .
so , that 's what i 'm doing .
that was the kind of <unk> part of the <unk> .
but i think you need to understand it , it 's worth changing .
and if i 'd say , it 's also like to be different , it 's like to live in life ,
but it 's always always again , but that 's the way you need to be a choice , but i 'm going to tell you a bit of time .
so what is it ?
and there 's what we have to do in our rich world that we 've been much more likely to have economic growth , in terms of quality , in terms of the average , not in the average , not in the average .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you know , you know , people do n't have to be able to do this story .
i 've been writing it .
and the same thing is the same cause .
we work too much too much .
this is on the side of a side , and it 's a lot of time .
i work very much like .
and on the other side , we 're going to be this <unk> .
what is a good life ?
how can we define this ?
now , a little scientific scientific .
and what i 've been told to say , and what i 'm going to say is , i 'm going to say , `` well , it 's just a bit of <unk> , but it 's just how i can do that , how can i define
and there 's important to understand life , and that 's the two aspects of the world .
life has the aspect of the objective conditions like what i eat .
i have a roof on the head ?
i have friends ?
i can relate to life , i can live in life ?
but also , how do i do it with me ?
i mean , i 'm going to get the cause of life .
and then i 'm going to have two words that are important to the point .
this is a needs .
the needs is the fundamental dimension of our human development , our way it 's going to be about feelings .
if we can satisfy our needs , we 're happy .
and needs you ca n't say , needs to be sustainable , or not sustainable .
you do n't need to do the <unk> of the <unk> .
what are needs ?
you can have different scientists , i just just heard two .
and there 's also the physical needs , but also , for a security , for social relationships .
for protection , for all , after creativity , creativity , freedom , freedom .
that 's what it has to do with money .
but in a big part of it , it 's not really the question , but i can tell me that i can do my life in my life .
and i 'm going to be the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy that i use to use to me is to make this needs .
and there 's it , i can do it with a high force or with a low force .
there can be a lot of money or money .
strategies , i think my behavior like i have my needs .
that has to do with my values , with the resources that i 've been doing .
if i do n't have to make a lot of money , i 'll try to make my needs , but when i do a lot of money , i 've been going to be able to buy a lot of money .
it 's all about the top that the roof is to eat the roof , and then , and then , the <unk> .
and here 's it , it can be a lot of little , or little resources that can be sustainable or be <unk> .
and if we all strategies that i have to get to my needs , we 're going to talk about a lifestyle .
so , that 's what i 'm doing .
this was the kind of scientific <unk> .
and now , what can we do ?
how do it like ?
and there just just just give some evidence .
and of course , you have to find that kind of thing for yourself .
but the evidence of the individual kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of engineering kind of , which is , i think , i 've been talking about technology , and then also also in a political way .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
the slides of the beginning , as i said , is the danger that we 're going to use more than more energy .
last , the quality of the life is worse , because the effects will be worse , and then we 're going to be back to the last time .
or whether we do it , it 's going to be a different direction , which is less , but less than a more efficient quality of life , but with a higher quality of life .
there 's a one of my favorite , maybe you know , maybe some of the best , so , more than the topic of the topic , more than the <unk> of the world .
so there 's a lot of technology , as i can do every single thing that we use , the computer , the orange , the coffee , the car , the car , how can you make that ?
so , i can make it different , i can make the house of wood , etc. , etc .
and to do it with much less resources , or the same quality of life .
my other teacher , more importantly , has to be the same , which is the <unk> , and we 're talking about what today has been already been there since there 's a lot of time in the way .
where are the needs ?
what services can i do ?
and how can i do that with the little <unk> ?
and not with a little bit of , but it 's more , , with three , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
there 's many examples that can be able to do .
in vienna , a tower is going to be used to be <unk> .
and with seven , it 's been been built in the workforce .
it 's basically <unk> .
you can do it in 50 years , and then you can go back and then then , and then , it 's not a lot of time , and it 's not much less efficient , but you 're going to get the whole time of the time
but it 's also a lot of our own , how do i do it ?
elena has a wonderful book , and it 's a wonderful book .
where he shows it , how hard it was , it 's really from the way from this diagram from this diagram .
the first thing i want to do is i want to go to the other , and then i 'm going to go in this race in this race .
you have a <unk> , i 've got to get a <unk> , and then i 'm going to get the new ones .
the most beautiful thing i know is that you know all of them .
when i was my first , a couple of years ago , we had letters .
then you can wait , you can get a letter to the letter , `` i 'm going to write a <unk> , ''
and i write hundreds of emails .
and i can make a lot more much .
this is productivity , that 's economic growth , we 're going to go back to the same .
but i did n't really have time .
i did n't have to do it .
but there are good examples , slow food for example , where i really really want to take the quality of quality and the value of the rest of the country .
and with a very low resources of life .
one of my favorite examples is .
there 's the world that 's been talking about that , that 's the average average person in germany , in germany , in a hundred years of <unk> , in the household .
you can start to count .
who two two generations had been two years ago , and they had employees .
the <unk> is the <unk> .
we need to be able to do it .
and there 's less people that are going to be clear with these whole options .
and need a <unk> , that helps us help us with these things .
i mean , i think , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , i mean , maybe you have to be able to take a <unk> of the spaceship , and i do n't have a thousand things .
the next example is , we 're going to use it .
a true boom .
star , , , , , , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , in the alternative , we were developed in alternative circles .
in the meanwhile , it 's more people , when they think about it .
if you think about it .
platforms are working in business , how can you work that we 've been doing this beautiful , so that a few hundred years ago , it has been used to be used to be used to the other centuries of the last time .
that 's what we need to do better .
this is the final thing to say , the question of justice .
i 've been showing you how <unk> this is , as a <unk> of africa , and europe and a world , a world .
so , that 's all the same time that we can use these resources , and then we can use less than we use less .
and that 's not just less life because many of us have been much more important .
but it 's a important task of economy , the companies that are doing these products , that we need to make a good life for a good life .
last thing that has been doing with the big policy policy for the growth , and i think it 's the time .
if you 're a little bit of the <unk> , it 's over the past , and the most important thing is , all of the time , that 's going to be the <unk> of the <unk> , and then it 's going to be the <unk> of
it 's called , yes , a crisis that 's going to be the door of my view , and what we 've been doing with a lot of economists talked about how many economists have been , and so they 're still going to have the numbers for
and there 's no reason to have more than how i learned that my youth , from the age of the <unk> .
and the part of the universe is the mathematical reasons .
one point of five percent growth is today as eight percent of the growth growth .
and the eight percent is that china has been today .
and there are also where we might have been expected to be 50 years ago .
in the whole way , if you have a bigger bigger , it 's still a lot of eight percent .
that 's a percent of the time that we 're going to do .
but you have to be able to be able to say , `` that 's not even a even more efficient growth , that 's the same year , that 's the next year , and we consume income and income as in this year .
we can do good and we can work on .
this is not because it 's not wrong because you know that the statistics is that the growth has been not working on the quality of life .
the economy is growing , but the quality of the quality of people in the way we 're going to be on the top of the <unk> .
and the way to work with jobs and it can not be so much as well as we 're going to get more and how they 're going to get the same , and how they 're going to get the <unk> .
and that 's not just the same thing , and then you have to be interested in the economy .
and it goes again and more more than the same , but more than the next week , i think , in the trend , a bigger story with this topic .
now , it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , who nobel prize in his nobel prize for his career , he said , `` good life , good economy , the good economy of the good economy .
it 's not about the last thing , not to do the world , not to create economic growth , not to create economic growth .
for the <unk> , and these countries , china , china , for india , is the <unk> of the other story .
and that 's just just going to be even further with the moment , when we 're going to grow up and we 're just going to go on this level , we 're going to be on this level of the level of the level , and we
it 's also going to be politics .
it needs to be goals .
it needs to say , `` economists . ''
it does n't need to be just just like the growth , but we should actually measure it and measure how it 's actually going to be the quality of life , which is the quality of the quality ?
is the <unk> ?
and then we also have to measure our politicians .
of course , how is the the <unk> ?
how do you do this ?
we need a fundamental aspect of the <unk> , and not the work .
who are one of them who are in the entrepreneurs , but they also know the ones who are good .
what kind of <unk> , we know , we know , we know , a <unk> <unk> .
that could be different .
the resources are <unk> , and therefore they are not the resources and not the work .
and you need to help all of the public education to create the world , for the <unk> , health , infrastructure .
but it 's , but there 's a little bit of it .
so , the <unk> , more , more or less , and in all of the advances can be able to be able to be able to do it , we can do it as a company , services , for consumers , for us , what we need
what do we need to do , we do n't need to do it ?
the right policy is the <unk> of our <unk> .
some of these things have been given .
and last of course , the science has been still the science of all the science still still in the direction , how can we make growth ?
but unfortunately , unfortunately , nobody did n't have .
if you look at the <unk> of the world , the last 20 years , it 's still going to be over the bottom .
politics ca n't do the science and not the science of the question , but that 's the question how we do with that , and so that we have a good life of this ?
so , `` you know , '' it 's a little bit .
you have the <unk> to go to the lake .
with heart , brain , hand , and the last thing we need to do is we need to need it .
thank you .
i 'm going to be more interested .
and i love this city .
this city has been a lot of stories .
one of a hundred years ago , it 's a few years ago .
and it 's too much more important .
and in this creative way , i 'm going to be going to be a little bit of the story , and i 'm going to tell you the story .
they 're going to do that with the <unk> .
this is the <unk> that 's in the middle of this city , and many of the city is also <unk> and it 's .
another story before .
it was at a hot summer in <unk> , nevada .
a man , as you know , in his shoes , it 's really true .
it 's warm .
he 's europeans , he does n't know that it 's the heat .
he makes he a <unk> <unk> , and he 's a <unk> <unk> , and it 's not a long time , and there 's a lot of holes in the <unk> .
he 's the shoe again , and he 's a new climate .
it 's the shoe , he 's born .
and these number you see here is the actual <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
a company is to have <unk> , with four letters .
one or other of you know .
he has the original idea of both <unk> and <unk> .
both of them .
so he says , well , i mean , i 'm going to make my own business company .
it 's the stock market in the stock market .
so , many thousand thousand workers in the <unk> <unk> in three countries in the world .
so much of the subject of creative .
why not new new york , which is not there ?
and <unk> , the question is the question of the <unk> <unk> .
if you do n't know , it 's what 's going to be a chance ?
this question is often helped me to be difficult in difficult situations .
when something happened to the same , or my <unk> or <unk> , or it does n't work or whatever .
and , , little memory , it 's more important .
what is this opportunity ?
and you 've got to get out of the <unk> .
what 's the difference for this example of this example .
and another example of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that 's the most important thing to be talking about .
and the evidence is how creative people can be able to make their own insurance insurance .
i want to show you some examples here .
so the fact that we 've been in the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> made it a <unk> .
i love the fantastic .
my son did n't have the woman .
he 's just the <unk> , that 's the woman 's <unk> .
or i had the whole day of <unk> , i 've been able to see the <unk> , and suddenly a <unk> , and i could n't see the other car .
so , that 's what it 's , or ?
the bush .
the consumer is more .
i 've been having a lot of time and two years .
and there 's a lot of time to do it at least the bottom of the u.s. .
the last thing i was not meant to do was the crash .
it was the young woman in the u.s .
if you 're a man , it 's another explanation .
if you 're a woman , you do n't know it 's not .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish i 'm going to tell you that we all have to be all of these creativity .
many of us are in a private election .
and that 's not going to be so much .
why do n't things make things like it ?
old things that we do is that we 're going to be <unk> , and it 's not a little bit about the opposite , and it 's the opposite .
why do n't just make it just different to the same , as small simple .
and there 's the same companies that are using the same .
for example , the first thing that you have to do is that they have to be on the <unk> of their <unk> , or the signs of the wall , and then it 's what it 's like .
and then a possibility , or ?
so the coffee for the <unk> for the moment .
or so what happens .
we have no <unk> , you have to be <unk> .
now , i 'm going to be on the right , right ?
if you ca n't get you anything .
or food , i 'll tell you , i 'll see them .
`` <unk> , but creative .
so it needs to be a little bit .
i mean , i want to go to the clients or the people and the other , okay , and i think that 's what i 'd like .
that 's what i 'm going to do .
a german campaign has been in the last time , and it 's in the case .
even the one of the news is the most important news , politics .
if you have three times in the <unk> , you have to be <unk> .
and then the complaint was the complaint for long time .
it 's a <unk> building and the restaurant very small , so they had to do the <unk> of all hands .
it was very deeply .
and the way we think , what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we ca n't get faster in the kitchen .
this idea is <unk> .
in every table , a <unk> has been <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and a <unk> .
so that 's the people that you think in the food , you can be able to get their own self .
just different .
a creative idea , and maybe it 's the best problem .
there 's a person who does n't just have <unk> .
you know , you know , the person is the leader of the future , so the best of the driver 's security .
and the <unk> is the german <unk> .
now , the second day , it 's going to be a little bit , so four days .
a company has been to have the <unk> for the month , and you may have to know what .
a more <unk> , you know , we 're going to thank you .
people come to us to come to the future .
the buses are full , it 's going to be <unk> , people <unk> , because of course , for a lot of , for example , for a b , for a b .
but why do n't we use it to be a little bit more efficient and creative ?
sometimes , it 's also going to be more important .
and it 's coming from a more <unk> way , like this company , you know , you know .
so we 've realized that it 's not really good , but it 's actually the same thing to do with it , but it 's something about that .
or in the car , it 's the car .
we know , we know , all of the different , and all kinds of directions .
yeah .
why do n't you have a piece of <unk> in the car , when you 're going to get it ?
or in the way , we have to be able to make the creative design .
and all of the things that do n't have to do with humor , with joy , with it , it 's stupid , right ?
sometimes it 's funny .
i was my first son in the office .
and it 's on this moment .
so we 've got to have several more <unk> to the top .
and then he 's left from the left , he 's joy , and i 'm going to tell you my mum listening to you , `` you 're not a playground here .
he looked at me , look at the big eyes , and the playground .
and in the moment i 'm really interested in , i was right ?
why is n't the playground ?
why is that what we do n't do with the playground for adults ?
that 's a lot of more than it 's going to be more more than it ?
if we 're trying to do our talents , we do n't want to do what we do .
and so , they 're doing it , but it 's kind of like it .
this is the strange thing that when a particular day is going to change what happens in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's our focus on a day .
so , one other day we 've been hearing .
so in the weekend .
that 's what you 're doing .
the problem is , just , just a day , just a day .
or if the most most exciting time was going to be the year , the vacation 's going to be on vacation .
what are the rest of the year ?
is it so terrible ?
so we have all of the terrible jobs ?
a single time , it was on the cover of the page .
yes , i can go , and the rest of you can ask yourself .
or on , on facebook , all over the social networks , it 's going to be a subject .
i was going to be through the first time , which is a <unk> of the interest .
there 's a lot of business and i look at this .
what is the same thing that 's going to be there ?
and one day , i would have to buy this business for this .
and the first sign that you see here is , yes , it 's really nice .
so , so , with love , i work with work .
i also have to be , i 'm also a parent , my father , but i love my work .
yeah .
or still , it 's the bottom of the country .
why is the own attitude that 's going to be <unk> , and it 's still more and more and more .
somebody has a answer to this direction , it 's not the monday , it 's your jobs .
and i really wonder in the pink pair , and i 'm going to say , okay , let 's go .
what 's my job ?
this stupid , if you 're the pink glasses , it looks like it 's all like before .
so , so , you do n't know that 's not beautiful , it does n't seem to be <unk> .
the pink glasses is very great to drive .
and it 's just a wonderful flying way that would be going to be able to be able to see the eye .
but not the same thing you do n't have to do .
where does we change that if we do n't change ?
actually , the job , the content , our strategic ?
within the company , outside of the <unk> .
it 's a place where we 're like , as we 're looking at the mouse .
the mouse goes up into this wheel and goes and goes and and then it 's going to be fast , and it 's going to be the <unk> , the arms and they 're going to get out .
what does the mouse do ?
you know , you know , you know , it 's going to be in the same room .
and again , again , again , and again , the movie day , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's soft .
so this is so much of the <unk> , so you 're still there , and it 's still going to be over and again .
and what we thought is that when we think about a funny , the mouse has a <unk> , yes , yes ?
or something that needs to be more important .
i was so much of a day , so i was walking from a <unk> home .
and on the street , the street was , it was black , and i have to stay in my eyes and somehow i have to stay .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , what is there ?
he was thinking , and said , it 's hard to be fine .
but how does it look at the consumer ?
and i looked at my iphone , and i saw it , and i was working for three weeks through the way i was doing it .
for 20 years , in the u.s. and participants who have been first in the early '90s , if we could do the first time we could do .
i thought , what is it going to do for jobs ?
and i started to start to go to the other priorities , and i think that i 'm going to spend my family for my family , something good for me .
and for the other , if you do n't have to be a <unk> , it 's a new <unk> .
i realized that the talks of the <unk> groups are really happy to make me happy .
i go to the <unk> and <unk> and other things , but these talks to each other , and that we can have more <unk> , which is really happy to be happy .
and that was not always that .
i realized that this is really sick of the <unk> ,
and sometimes it 's really the <unk> of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the time , it 's been coming from the hospital , after he had a heart attack , and he
when i said , you 're going to leave you , i always have to get it , and you know , you 're going to go with your fingers , and you 're going to go with your fingers .
today , it 's a way .
so , so , with the same , , very slowly , but we 're going to be going to go to the right , but eventually we 're going to go to a lot of time .
what happens ?
the bottom is all the healthier .
the first line goes down , but a curve is that the conditions is because of mental health .
and three percent of the last 10 percent of the last 10 years , almost almost 100 percent of the , that 's beautiful , that 's less .
the mental disease is increasing , plus two percent .
that 's something where i think i think that 's going to be this ?
why is that ?
is this just in austria ?
no , it 's like it 's .
and , , , , , , that 's all healthier .
this is the left on the left .
but there 's a lot of mental diseases , almost a hundred percent of the last 10 years , a big german <unk> .
the number of the <unk> is going to be <unk> .
the cost of the cost .
and it 's all kinds of <unk> , what can we do with this topic ?
and so , you can do some of these things , as you can get more <unk> , as example , as example .
so , it 's good .
and somebody said , no alcohol , no alcohol .
but what is the solution ?
what is that , what we do is still healthy and it and joy ?
and that 's the last years .
i think , `` well , what is it going to be like to be a little bit of it ? ''
i 'm like , the job is not that what we 're going to do with us and happy .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , and so forth .
but fact , we 're the most part of our work in the work .
and if we do n't do that , why do n't we make it feel so much and others .
the best for me , i want to pay for them to be more than last year and to pay for the first time .
these little <unk> , you 'll get it to the moment .
and for talent , for talent , freedom and environment .
that 's what i mean , `` what is my talents ? ''
in the environment , i do that , who 's what i do with the people ?
what freedom i do is what i want to do ?
because the degree of the <unk> is to be the <unk> .
more more than the more stress .
and what do i do ?
the <unk> .
these are four areas .
and it can be a true thing for yourself .
i had to look for me to look at me and i 've been going to get back again .
can i have my talents ?
in what environment ?
and that means , sometimes i put a cafe in my laptop , to get a <unk> or a <unk> .
the freedom .
what freedom can do is i think what 's important .
and i do n't want to go ?
the <unk> .
the last <unk> .
and then there 's always people who tell me why this is not .
and why do you get much harder .
and i 've been going to have a answer to this point .
who wants to find out of ways .
who 's not , it 's reasons .
and by the point , you can ask you , i 'm going to make sure , i 'm going to make a lot of ways , and i have to ask for reasons ?
and they 're going to be in two right .
so what do we do with our own ?
everybody has to be aware of his great .
it 's too much small .
it 's filled with with private , with gold , with all sorts of things , with their skills .
what do we do ?
by the end of the end , we 're going to be able to do this .
or if we 're in the hospital or the end of life .
what did i do with my own ?
the way that you 've got to have to be on , for the moment , you have to be able to have a lot of time .
so what do we do with our talents , my first question , and i think it 's a day .
so , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean enough enough ?
and resources .
there was something else with a story .
i wanted to tell you about the <unk> .
and that 's what i 'm doing to do .
this was the <unk> of the year for the first time than five years ago .
and the enemies realized that this was made that <unk> was so good , they could n't make them .
thick walls are also looking for the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it was the time .
so , what we thought is that we 're not going to go back , we 're going to get a <unk> .
we do n't have to go out there .
and as long as the ones that do .
the first time it was getting out of the day , where they were almost <unk> .
she had only been a <unk> that was on the way to be <unk> as the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> me to give me this three days and give me three days .
<unk> , you have to get you , you 've got to get you , and you get to get the <unk> , and help us .
and it 's going to be the way to go to the future .
and at the top , the enemies of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> has been going to be going to go back to the left and then in the early early .
well , think about that , what 's happening .
it 's a morning .
again , it 's a <unk> , <unk> wall on the wall , it 's black .
enemies think , oh , the two , you can have two , it can be a little bit .
the same thing that i 've been doing is this time , it 's the <unk> of the <unk> , and it 's going to be a <unk> .
the end of the second day after the six different , you 've got to go down to the <unk> .
because they thought that it takes us to us , we do n't have to be more interested in .
after the first time , the election goes down to the election , and the more successful .
the one they had , they have them .
and that 's the <unk> of the <unk> .
i like this thought that everything is , we need to have it .
sometimes it 's <unk> resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's little .
but also , we can do something .
we have no idea of the power that we 've created the world .
and if you believe that it might be a good job , you have right .
in the spring , the spring .
the <unk> .
and we 're in the middle of the snow , because it 's going to be warmer , the plants of the <unk> of the <unk> , to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
there are hundreds of things that are coming from these blooms of fruits .
there 's a <unk> here , we 're able to eat the harvest and eat food .
there 's grain of corn and it can be <unk> and bread .
there are any animals that we eat .
there are people who are going to eat the products that they eat .
and it 's automatically automatically .
but if you think about it , it 's not that it 's going to be a fear and <unk> .
and of course , this is the threat very abstract and very very , but in the area of the <unk> , the <unk> of the plant is the plant of the plant , and it 's very big .
there are research that we 've been looking at to the first percent of our food , especially if we were n't not any bees .
so that 's what it seems to be as much as it 's as normal , and we may not think it 's not as much as it 's .
there was a very interesting movie , and it was a very interesting film .
and i recommend you , you know , look at it .
now , now we 're going to ask us to the gentleman who 's working on the <unk> of the bees who are in my school , in the importance of bees .
this is what he 's going to be in a school school and he 's going to tell us some about his work .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
just a big thank you , and you know , the whole thing .
i 'm going to talk to my project , more and more more than the life of the bees .
and also , there 's a wing of a wing to a little bit about little more important to tell you about the power .
i think that the most important thing is to be in the most important way , today , today , today , we have to be a <unk> company in <unk> to be <unk> in the basics of the world .
i do n't do it .
but maybe it 's really important to make them that they want to be to love and a certain empathy to develop them and engage them with this , and they 're going to be <unk> with the <unk> of the honey .
my name is thomas , i 'm married , i 'm a young woman with a wonderful woman married , father , who 's not married , and i 've been working with the same and <unk> and work in the past , and for the time , for
i 'm a member of the federal interest and in the u.s .
and work in the workforce , the most important students in the workforce is the most important students in the workforce .
we work in the garden , in the agriculture and in the field .
and it 's actually a game of the <unk> , and it 's more important to be supported by the moment .
our flying classroom is a <unk> , a quiet thing , a quiet thing .
and they 're also going to be quiet .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not for the old greeks , the <unk> greeks have the relationship between honey and the private election , and the best of the defense has been .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he describes his <unk> to his <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , he can inspire him that he can be able to be able to see it .
but the private sector is n't even going to go to the <unk> , but they send their blue bees and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the mouth and then he says , `` honey , '' and he goes to the words like honey
a nice picture .
hopefully i want to leave this tonight .
yeah .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of this , this is the first time that i 've been working with my students with me , for 30 years to be a year .
in the schools in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the family , in the family , or the ministry of security , in the u.s .
and a more security for the interest in the <unk> , in the <unk> .
the teacher that this project is going to be with me with the class and we 're looking at a space for a moment .
most of the window that you see in the window of the children , as the month .
and all of these things , the bees that are going to go into the <unk> and then get it .
and then it 's going to put the window into the window .
so , that 's what i 'm doing .
and then it starts to me .
so i 'm going to take a <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and so you 've got to put a little bit of two two and you 're going to go here in this room .
so , in this case , these are the <unk> bees .
also , we have to have to have <unk> , and here has to be <unk> , <unk> <unk> , fresh eggs .
and then you also have a date , here 's the top .
there 's the honey inside .
you need to be bad , if you 're bad weather , you ca n't fly .
so , that 's what i 'm doing .
so this is what it looks like .
and then the <unk> goes back to the moment , and immediately it starts to go on the public for the public or the moment for the public school .
and now , it starts something wonderful .
ladies and gentlemen , these bees are in the class of the class , a crisis .
they do n't have more .
they 're lonely .
they 're not going to do their queen .
and that 's the most important task for the moment that it 's going to be the same thing that it 's going to be the queen of the <unk> .
so that 's not the two .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they 're starting to be <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they 're <unk> .
you hear that .
they spend almost more than you usually usually die in their own with a queen .
and now , it starts a little bit .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night , you need to have a new people , and that 's not all the time , but the whole thing , without conferences , without <unk> , without talking about the world , and the positions .
here 's the people who agree and then then come in the first night .
because without queen , this would be a lot of six weeks ago .
because the only time is only six weeks .
so , that 's what i 'm doing .
and in this first night , you get a pencil that 's a pen and bring it into this .
and there 's the <unk> <unk> .
everybody who had to be in high school , and how do you want to go to the right ?
yes , it 's genetically modified , but all of it has been genetically modified .
that 's true .
and now , it starts something wonderful .
this is what we 're going to be in the <unk> of the <unk> , in the election , in the election , the queen is a queen .
the <unk> is the first three days of the same code as the <unk> .
after that , it 's going to be a <unk> of a <unk> .
you know this term .
and immediately , it 's going to be on the same code of the genetic code .
the consumer is going to be the <unk> of the consumer in the u.s .
we 've heard that before we heard that we 're going to eat what we 're going to do .
and the queen is really wonderful .
three days , five days .
and that can be the students that all of the students .
and that 's what you see in education .
and then this cell is going to be a <unk> <unk> and the whole thing that does n't even have because the people are going to be a <unk> , or because a more <unk> , or you want to say , `` you 're going to be a
no , that 's what happens .
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> .
and then , the students spend eight days every student , three five eight , the queen is the queen of the queen .
and so the day , if you want to be able to do the teacher , the teacher has been the <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> in the morning , the <unk> in the morning , yes .
and then , the mother , tell you what 's going to go ?
yes , i need to be in school .
yes , why ?
yes , our queen .
yeah ?
and then the morning in six school .
and then the <unk> of their <unk> is to be the <unk> , because they want to be the queen , and the queen is the queen .
and if you can experience it , you 'll hear something about something .
this queen .
so , that 's what i 'm doing .
even a little bit higher .
and then the <unk> and the <unk> is free .
the first thing that the queen does , they 're going to have their wings and so with their own people , their <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> .
the people has been a identity .
now , three days for five days .
and the first time you 're going to see your <unk> .
the back of the <unk> is coming out of the people , from this .
and after five days , this queen is not coming from the <unk> .
some think , well , i 've seen this , so , i 've seen this one .
stop , that .
what 's completely different .
-- let 's go .
this is the queen that 's not alone without <unk> , without <unk> , from the two miles to two miles .
you 've seen it in your zeppelin .
in the moment , and it 's going to be a <unk> , for three years , to be 12 , and the male bees .
so the way in islam where the man are going to have a lot of women , the queen , the queen , the seven men .
and this is a wonderful way in the flight .
the drone comes from the back of the queen , and the queen is now , in this time , all of the seeds that they need to get three years to go into the eggs .
for the drone , it 's an amazing experience .
if you finished it , you 're going to die and dead dead .
and then the queen goes back again and starts to go eggs .
there are always two students in the class that they see .
the watch is the queen .
yeah .
and then finally , the project in school because we 're going to go to the top and the queen and the <unk> and the <unk> is going to be in the <unk> .
and then i come back to a evening , and then i was going to be on this .
and the first time the <unk> of the outside , and the next morning , i leave this with the queen and these bees for me .
and there 's the queen .
yeah .
<unk> .
and it 's mostly 10 to 12 .
and then , this is , these two , this is going to be a <unk> in a moment .
in a full stick , in a <unk> and now , you can be a big big <unk> .
why do bees go in school ?
ladies and gentlemen , the children who have never seen the world , never ever .
yeah .
there 's not just that in this class , the students all the time with the bees , but the whole school is in the class .
and the teacher , if he knows something if he 's something he can be there , he 's a time for the other one .
look , bees and <unk> , we 've been working in the <unk> of the <unk> , where people have the honey .
a few months ago , in israel , in israel , the people had been found in the people that we were going to have the bees .
any human culture has been working with bees .
or the other , the bees were in every culture .
in china , india in india , in egypt , in greece .
all they were .
the human cultures ladies and gentlemen , and they 've been <unk> .
he can be a <unk> , a more <unk> , he can be a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , what flowers do or trees , what they need ?
so there 's something like it 's going to find out in the summer of agriculture .
there 's the green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can go to the students in the <unk> and there are flowers of bees , and they can look at the same , and look at how long to the <unk> of my flowers ?
how long are you going to get these individuals ?
and how long you need to come back back back to them .
he can be able to do it .
how do i have a <unk> ?
yeah .
you know , if that is that that is the top of the top , or flat flat side is on the top , it 's a little bit on the top ?
look at it .
he can be a math -- which is a <unk> .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can actually work with the students to have the highest quality of this .
and then he 's going to ask the question , how could <unk> <unk> <unk> from the nobel prize ?
because he thought that the bees can see the bees in the hive .
but ladies and gentlemen , in a beehive , it 's <unk> .
there 's a bee in nothing .
and only the professor , who has been working in the university of the university of the university , in the university of the <unk> , the bees have to have a private interest in the <unk> .
so as a <unk> net , the <unk> of the <unk> has to be a private , and now , with the <unk> <unk> , and the bees who are going to be the <unk> , and the bees who are going to get their legs with their legs
see what these bees do in school ?
it 's been a <unk> <unk> , and the children lose their fear of bees .
and then a awareness of bees .
they learn to be , what do the bees do .
and they get an operation that 's just going to be just a <unk> of people in the moment .
the bees do n't make a <unk> per capita a year .
but the only way to make the only opportunity to make candles .
they 're collecting the <unk> of the trees .
this is a <unk> , which is what they 're doing .
and now imagine , in summer , the summer , the <unk> , and the bees are in a very small space , in the <unk> .
hey , there are diseases of the end of the end .
no , no , no , no .
because they have to be in this total natural gas .
they 're collecting pollen , and it 's that it 's going to be <unk> , it 's going to be a <unk> .
somebody who 's working on the top of the election is , he 's <unk> , who 's more likely to be able to go to a government and a more comfortable exam , by helping the people that 's the <unk> of the people .
and of course , there 's a grid that has been working with and with a little bit of , and so , it 's not a little bit of it .
yes , and then ladies and gentlemen , the <unk> of the bees , and we have less <unk> , if the bees could n't fly , or we would like to have the chinese , and they 're going to be <unk> .
there 's a lot of more important .
look at the <unk> , there 's the <unk> of the <unk> , where they 're <unk> .
and there 's the bee behind the bee , and it 's going to be a <unk> and <unk> that .
and now the cow and the <unk> and the only time , because they can use it , because they can use it .
yeah ?
and then you get the back , and you see , ah , i 've got to be married , ah , i can be back .
and then it 's milk .
the power is the bee .
yeah ?
and then the bee is the bee of the most important thing that 's the most important thing to be on nature .
honey .
i want to leave you to the point .
my students are going to be every year when they 're going to build this and then part of the schools in the schools .
so that 's not my job but i had a student and i said , `` i 've been in the high school in the school , and i said , `` you know , you have to go to you .
and then he says , well , i 'm getting hot .
i come from the three and i 'm going to have 20 years .
and i 've been for five years in the past , and since two years , i was in the u.s .
and i 'm glad i 'm not going to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn the hands of the hands .
and , yes , it 's the head .
and a date , the <unk> , high school .
and more than half , oh , yes , we want to be able to do that .
my students are a huge appreciation and the <unk> between <unk> , and the people are going to be <unk> by the bees .
and on a game , you get them and you get your students , and a certain pride .
how do you get the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you should say , how does you get to the consumer ?
and there 's a lot of people , there 's the human beings who are going to be more and a new <unk> .
and he says , `` well , let 's start with this .
at the end of a little poem , it 's been <unk> .
who 's the bee the bee would be the sun that 's the way the sun 's losing the limb and never the direction of the air , but the <unk> in the <unk> , he was just going to kill him .
thank you .
hello , love friends in all the world .
welcome to my project .
this project my person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a end of female <unk> .
in my eyes , the biggest crime of humanity , because it has been over years since the years .
the society against women still have more than a day .
first , i 'm going to imagine .
my name is , i 'm going to come from <unk> .
i 've been working for a <unk> job .
you can think that i did n't have to be the job of the job .
i did n't feel more .
and i was glad i was glad to be able to speak to the theme of my job and more exciting .
for example .
with a massive <unk> of the atlantic of africa , brazil 's <unk> .
on the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the genocide is the genocide of the last <unk> of the defense .
that was a way where i had more than more than more than more than the more than the more successful .
but yet , these are kind of <unk> that really important media and even a little human as i could make his world in the language of language .
i 've been working with my own <unk> in ethiopia .
in the middle of the war , and we were <unk> , and we were <unk> of this <unk> .
and despite all of the <unk> , we were able to remember the other side of the infinite hospitality of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
and so , once we 've been sitting on , we were two and two groups that they see that they 're seeing with their bodies as a living , and the <unk> , they were the ones that are my people .
if you want to get you to you , you get to get them through it .
something like i found in no other culture .
and then in young years , you learned that islam is not about terrorism .
they 're not going to be <unk> to their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but it 's really true to the real values like love , social responsibility .
the values that are worth caring about .
after many years , i 've been going to come back to this year , and i 've been working with my wife .
and then we heard that this was the <unk> female <unk> .
when i heard that the <unk> percent of the daily victims are the most important , and i 've been thinking about the most important thing , as a <unk> , as islam is , in general , the most important thing is going to be the shoes of
and the idea was that the highest students of islam led to the <unk> to explain the <unk> .
we were looking at the <unk> of the germans , who did n't find them .
so we had to be able to remember that we 're going to be really aware of the <unk> , which is not the privilege of islam .
you would like the <unk> .
in the <unk> , we have to have our own organization , we have to have our own organization .
and they were all of the interest and <unk> .
and so to do this battle , we needed to be able to do images .
it was a lack of lack .
and so , and i went to the desert , and i went to the desert to make the pictures of the images .
the bad <unk> pictures that i do n't show you , but i want to be a <unk> .
girl in age of four weeks , at the wedding end of their parents and the family , the earth 's <unk> , and you 're sitting on the limbs , and you 're going to leave the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk>
what you 're going to do is a push of the size of a <unk> .
and your next is a bonus .
if you 're your first , you 'll get two weeks .
it was <unk> , and soul , their dignity , and their dignity .
that was the beginning of the first election .
in the <unk> , it goes on .
the man needs to open up .
he never had a woman .
the uncle said , `` oh , <unk> , no problem .
you 're going to put your penis with your <unk> and then you get hard .
and if you ca n't do it , it 's not bad .
then you take the knife and they 're doing it .
that 's the first time .
it 's a third girl .
this had three months ago .
shock that the girl has lost their language .
that 's the most important , in asia .
most of the <unk> is <unk> .
and when we were muslims , why did you have this ?
and the first answer is that we need to do this is the koran .
nothing is in the koran , the opposite .
every <unk> every day every day in their prayer , as a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
but they seem n't to believe what they 're doing .
they had a <unk> to be a <unk> of women who 's <unk> and therefore , as you can be more than the <unk> , women could be more <unk> .
but now we had the pictures of the first <unk> of this .
he 's all of us to be all of us to be a conference .
there were hard discussions , two days .
but we had the health of our side , the highest quality of our side .
and then the great decision is that the <unk> is against all human rights , against religion , we have to be <unk> .
as last , the <unk> has been <unk> by the new <unk> .
and if you have africa and the quality , you know , you know , you know , it 's just that people .
and it was , and it was <unk> and that successes we were also in other countries .
so , short example , we have to be the highest security of the highest , the best of the country is that there 's a crime in <unk> , and that 's the <unk> to the <unk> .
weeks , we were going to be on a <unk> <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had .
and where we come , we 're just open , open , open , and the historical <unk> , holy hospitality .
and when we wanted to leave the country , i wanted to be the great <unk> and private interest , you want to be all of the countries in the world ?
so much of the life will be not more than you 're going to do .
he 's right .
i 'm going to be a little bit of it , and you have to get it back to the point .
and it was a idea of it .
he said , if you can get the 10 to the world , the world 's a table to make a table and the <unk> to the <unk> , it 's a sin .
and i went to the <unk> and i went to <unk> in the <unk> , and the mosque , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and for the moment , for the moment , he 's really interested in the contract , his elected professor , who has been elected to have a <unk> , and we had to have a date .
he heard the idea was very excited , especially when we could use this , we would be able to be able to do that .
and that 's what we 're doing for the <unk> .
and then he said , `` i 'm not going to do the conference for the way we 'd been asking him , but i 'm going to get the <unk> .
and that 's what he did .
and over cairo , we 've got to be in the <unk> of our transparent agenda .
international security is to be the <unk> of the female body by <unk> .
under the moment of the professor , the professor of professor <unk> .
and all they 've got .
a hundred <unk> , but the highest world .
in the middle of the middle of the <unk> , the man has been in <unk> , and in the rest of europe , he 's the lowest part of the <unk> of the cartoons .
so men can live and death .
but also the other .
the left is the first time , the right , the first , my credit .
the highest world .
i 'm going to tell you about the only time and a <unk> of personal personal .
and then i 've got all of them .
it started the conference .
and under our sign , the <unk> of the left is to be egypt .
the highest quality of the highest egypt , for the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> , germany , germany .
so much of the theme of islam is not the privilege .
we also had to have the medical care that they 've been working on their own , what was terrible women , and they have to be with the <unk> .
and then you have to show her film , and then you have to show it .
reality .
the men had <unk> <unk> .
they moved back to the <unk> doors for two hours , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , a <unk> .
the first thing we 've got to do is the cameras , the cameras , which was what they decided .
and the most important sentence was that this was this .
female <unk> is a private crime against the highest values of islam .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought , the job was done , but the <unk> without our part .
because the shame of the woman 's wife is still more than any understood .
we have to have it .
we 've got this conference in this called the golden <unk> book .
one of the <unk> for the world .
and because , because , the <unk> , it was , it 's been good , the book , he has been a <unk> .
it 's going to be the hands of the hands .
we were in many countries , at the time , we have to have the highest <unk> .
and they were talking about the interest of some of these things that they 've been told .
unfortunately , most of the courage to do is also too well .
the <unk> of the woman is not going to talk to the mosque .
just some of the courage .
they 're at least in the universities , in <unk> .
and sometimes we have some <unk> <unk> in the united states , in the mosque , like this .
and then it goes beyond the <unk> .
and these are the ones that are .
it 's spread .
but i 'm going to tell you the time .
it 's all <unk> , <unk> stones , and i work on many other strategies that 's going to be a topic .
the practice is going to stop .
but my favorite thing is that this is the way that it would be .
i want to be the great message of the highest <unk> of the world who 's <unk> in the kaaba , in mecca .
not to be in the same election , but in the u.s .
if there are four million people together , men and women are islamic and women .
and then i 'm going to go with all the <unk> and the <unk> king , my transparent <unk> <unk> .
so i 've been working on the <unk> .
unfortunately , i 've been still the last time that 's the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure if he 's going to be able to go back .
for one of these women .
the other thing to show you the world is the real values of islam , instead of trying to go .
and the terrorists was as much as the <unk> .
if i do n't want to do this , i might be able to do this in hamburg , which is in hamburg .
that 's the most of the <unk> in the world in the world .
and we can be able to <unk> our <unk> .
and maybe i 'm going to be able to do that little girl does n't have to be able to do it .
and then my life was pretty much .
and i want to be hearing that you 've heard that , and i 've seen it .
and not a <unk> , it 's a <unk> .
we need to have the need to get the <unk> in the ton , and i do n't have to do this stage .
and now i want to show you the design of my first time .
that 's my interest , my job .
and this is in all the time in the <unk> of the name of the <unk> , and the other thing that has to be .
there 's also the case , in german .
female <unk> is the koran and the <unk> of islam .
it 's been a <unk> of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so i start with this .
so , the <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> , when they were in germany .
the best for my mother , my mother , my brother and i first got a little bit of <unk> .
it 's <unk> .
my mother was completely horrified because they did n't understand why they have been eating food .
the third day we 've been finally done .
we were going to go back to the <unk> , and then it was a <unk> woman , and it was just the <unk> of the <unk> .
they tried to explain that they can eat food .
this is not <unk> .
it tastes pretty good .
it 's cheese .
my mother was the <unk> and we laughed .
cheese .
in my country , we have n't been <unk> , but it 's not like it .
i 'm more interested in the age of the age .
i was a <unk> , i 'm my mother and my brother of china , and my brother 's germany .
and that 's what i 'm going to tell you about this .
but it 's really about that people who have to have this <unk> and success success .
but first , i tell you where i 'm going to come out of the <unk> .
i 'm going to be a believer .
so , the <unk> is a little bit of the <unk> in the northwest of china .
and this region is the chinese <unk> <unk> .
it 's about the <unk> of germany .
in china , in china , in china , in china , in china , the largest <unk> of the world is the largest <unk> of china .
and this is why we have to be in china under china under the <unk> of the suffering .
hundreds of chinese were been sent to the <unk> of our own home to be a minority .
our own language , the education was <unk> .
in schools and in universities , they 're just chinese .
and our religion can not be free .
the <unk> is losing their culture and identity .
and if someone is <unk> , and for the right , the <unk> of the <unk> is not a child , or even death .
that was why my parents decided to have children to teach us .
that was the first time , and i was 11 years old .
this photo is just a <unk> of our <unk> .
we had n't had enough money , so i had to leave my father .
i 'm going to tell me a lot of people who helped us in the <unk> .
i 'm going to tell you a lot of images .
i 'm going to tell me to first of my first time to be honest .
i 'm just going to tell him that i 'm going to be my eyes .
he was big , and we had to be <unk> , and we had to be with his little <unk> in a parking parking .
the first time was <unk> .
i know that many of the <unk> is a negative picture of the only business , they 're not supposed to be <unk> for the <unk> , and not to be interested in the rights .
but i 'd like to say , `` i want to call him more than the <unk> , ''
because we 've got to be married for months .
he was at the airport in the airport , and for the last night , we had to be really sure that we were really safe by the <unk> .
airport in the hospital , i had to go to the way i know , and i know how my mother was going to go out of the airport .
you do n't think you 're going to do it .
we 're going to go out there .
because i had my hand in my hand , and there was my photo , but there was a <unk> name , it 's a <unk> name .
i had to be more interested by the <unk> .
and i 've got to remember my <unk> , i had to put my <unk> in the hand .
silence .
<unk> .
a long look .
we 've got to be successful .
in <unk> , i was interested in a lot of <unk> who were very <unk> .
i 'm going to tell me the first woman who worked with us in the workforce .
in a more time , four percent of the family has been a <unk> family .
at least , we have to be <unk> .
and a <unk> and a kitchen .
there was strangers faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to share a date .
it was eaten , and homework did n't work .
friends came to visit me because i was going to be a <unk> where we were .
only my job in the middle of the school was .
she knew my story and <unk> and i was very interested in me .
for example , i 've got to tell you what i do n't do anymore .
but they helped me to be used to be <unk> .
i spent my whole time in the door .
that was not just my mom .
and in fact , with children with children , and the reason we have a <unk> , and we had a <unk> , and then we could be a <unk> , and then it 's going to be a <unk> .
i 'm really afraid i was very much very aggressive .
it 's also a little bit embarrassing , but i have to tell you , but i have to tell you my story .
i was very aggressive and i could be able to focus in the school .
and the first time we had to first have to be successful in the first time we were in the first time with a normal child .
i mean , i do n't have to be able to do my kids in a hospital .
i 've been interested in my brother and my brother or the <unk> .
just let 's just go out of the way .
i 've been working for me to have a lot of time to have a lot of homework , because our parents were not a german .
or the ones we have just just <unk> .
we 've got very happy .
i know how we were always standing on the fence , and waiting for people , because they were thinking about people , and that was the time that we were interested in the time .
after two years , my father came up to germany .
the problem was that he was actually interested in the <unk> of the <unk> , because it was n't in <unk> , it was no longer there .
i 'm really interested in the very <unk> who was able to have a <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> of china , and he managed to make it in <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm going to tell me that i really was very glad to be very happy , because after six years , we had to be able to be able to get a normal place .
we had a three years for three years and we had a own apartment in a own and a own kitchen .
and i had even a room .
it was very small and i had no desk in it , but it was good , i could open my door .
and i 'm going to tell me that i was very good , but i had to have a lot of time to go to the school .
i saw myself really a perspective .
and there was a <unk> that i 've been working on the past , and it 's still the idea that i 've been going to have to be the second of my <unk> .
first , the first time we 've got to be .
i really enjoyed the teachers who really believed me , and i was n't just just the time i was going to go to the middle of the <unk> .
after i came to the first time .
and before i was at the first time , i was going to be at my best friend in my best friend .
and it 's a organization or a project of the organized system .
but i was n't good for the first time i just had to do it because we had to go through a place where we could just go .
we had a valve that we had to put our <unk> .
and the <unk> of the <unk> helped us to tell us that we could tell us our problems and he could help us and help us all of us .
and after i came to the date , i was going to be interested .
and this is a project where young people had a student to be a <unk> , and they need to be a <unk> .
and that really really worked very well , and i realized , art is something that i 've been doing .
and by the <unk> , and the <unk> was a <unk> , a <unk> .
he made the film to the life of my friends and i .
and the film won a lot of awards .
we realized that people were interested in our history .
he was a very special feeling because we never had it to be told that people were listening to us .
and that was a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want to do it anymore .
i want to make something out of my life .
a collaborator of interest , a <unk> for refugees , for me to come to the idea of the idea of the interest of the interest .
but i was in the <unk> building , i had a little bit of a <unk> , and i was a little bit of a game , and the title is three to four .
so i was right .
i played with it .
and the great thing is that after a performance of two <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , i 'm going to be on the <unk> .
and i asked me to be wondering if i had to make it better .
i thought , great , <unk> .
i 'm going to do it .
and i made it for the <unk> , and i 'm going to get a second , and i have a little bit of my parts of a piece of a piece of mine , which i 've been working on for the european union .
and i 've won it .
now i study the school for the school and film <unk> , and i 've been in the third year , and i 'm going to be the <unk> .
and that would n't be possible for me to do n't have any or organizations or organizations like to be interested in the same way .
they 've made me made me open , and they 've made me how i can make my place in the society .
and so i 'm going to tell you .
each of you have to be able to help people like to help me and get their lives or their lives in society .
because people are going to get a thousand refugees from a <unk> , and each of them are full of hope and each of them have a big potential .
they have to make a lot of <unk> , many terrible barriers behind us .
and with this determination , you could be really big for germany and for each individual .
and i could do a lot of things that you can do , but i do n't have enough time to have a minute , but i 've got a minute , i 've got to tell you a little bit of a date .
no , you can do your cell phone , you ca n't tell you that you ca n't buy a code .
scan you put the code and then you get the side of the <unk> of you with many suggestions , which can do you .
and that would be good .
i 'm so much for you for your engagement and we can see it .
and then you scan the code .
i 'm going to be a little bit .
many of the cell phones are not in the hand .
you have to be , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
and it 's true .
just a <unk> <unk> .
so i 'm sure that we 're going to be connected .
my name is <unk> .
my more <unk> is easier to talk about it .
i come from austria , that 's in vienna .
i 'm going to tell you very much today , but i 'm going to be very beautiful .
i 'm going to give you a little bit of time .
and this is not an expression , that 's a feeling .
yes , yeah , in contrast , i 'm not going to talk to you about something about something .
i did n't know what .
but it 's like that i write writing my little talk in my time and this talk about it , but it 's going to be more important , but it 's about the same time , or the same thing about the world .
yes , i was asked to be a couple of texts , which is a little bit of text that the whole program was a little bit .
and so , i 'm going to do this .
yeah .
i start with a joke .
and they 're two chickens .
so , so , the two , two english , i 've been working with the same , and so i 'm not paying attention to , but i 've been very much about the time , and i 've been working on the more successful time .
he 's the other yeah .
he ca n't tell you about the <unk> .
we have to be able to put this area .
the first text is a little bit of that i 've been hearing .
i 've got to tell you a person that 's going to be part of what 's happening .
it 's called the title .
and yes , they did n't understand it .
when your head in my lap was <unk> , your rest of my ceiling .
my leg was under my ceiling , the ceiling was outside the ceiling .
my leg was long through the ceiling .
it 's about your head , you 're going to be on my lap , the rest of your ceiling , my leg , the ceiling is the ceiling outside the ceiling .
that 's the same time when i was very high .
it was very romantic .
the next text i was going to give you a person who 's very much more important .
and my grandpa .
we have no longer involved .
my grandfather was a lot of <unk> .
and as a child , he has love with love .
so i 'm just like that .
yes , you 're going to be text .
better .
jesus is the only <unk> on the <unk> of the bus .
but where was jesus when he was going to save this <unk> ?
now , think ?
i 've got to have my job ?
next text .
the next text is a little bit more longer .
he takes a little hours .
so , the way you write .
read about faster .
it 's the beginning of a novel , which i 've been going to tell you about the <unk> .
ah , it 's about the <unk> , so the <unk> of the man who are still trying to get the hair and a little bit of a little bit .
i 'm still going to remember this point of view of the distance , and i 'm going to distance myself from the distance .
because i never would have to be the hair .
chapter one .
when i 'm going to get my head empty .
so empty , the paper that he tried to do .
yeah , i 'm not going to come .
very hard to a hours .
the next text is a little bit more .
most people do n't understand it .
i 'm going to do myself too hard .
and this is what i 'm going to play with my passion and with my language .
i 've always been thinking about my play .
and yes , then you get things out of things .
it 's called the title .
it 's a little bit strange .
it 's probably the most important thing that i ever ever ever have .
we can see it .
yes , we 're <unk> .
we can all can .
we need to be <unk> .
i ca n't do it .
but i can .
i can do it .
i ca n't do it .
yes , i did n't understand it .
no idea .
yes , yeah , i 'm coming from .
i say , `` no , no , no .
the next piece of paper is to do with text .
it 's kind of like a little bit .
i 've been doing the same for insects .
very simple .
yes , you 're going to be text .
it 's a little bit more important .
and it 's just about it , if i think that you can be able to say that you might be able to say that .
my text is called the title , all good things .
so so we 've got to keep up so dry .
we need to be <unk> .
so , you have to have a little bit , and you know , and you 're going to get the whole better and it 's going to be the whole better , and it was .
beautiful .
yes , even the same thing , that 's another one .
and it 's just about that , so i can make it so that we can all make the way that we could make all the way that we 're going to do all the time .
exactly what the wind does .
the text is called the name of the <unk> , and it 's the way that 's going to be .
yeah .
it 's fun .
the first text is just just a sentence .
i write it like little .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> .
<unk> ?
yes , yeah .
it 's fun .
yes , another sentence .
it 's in the <unk> .
it 's a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible to explain it in <unk> , that 's the point .
here 's another text .
this day is a <unk> .
it 's the title of text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows .
he has been before before i had this <unk> .
he was made me to be <unk> , and he would be going to be able to go to me .
i can tell me later in him .
i made him the joy .
it 's as a <unk> of all other days , and i 'll sleep .
with a <unk> <unk> , where would you go ?
and intent is not to be more restrained by me .
and i would n't go back to the day , not to be a <unk> day .
there are hope , or ?
now , it 's time for a little joke .
what was einstein said , `` he did n't know if he did n't want to be <unk> ?
i 'm going to show you .
so , that 's what i 'm doing .
letter , the cow is like the cow .
so that 's fun .
yes , the next text has been made by the paper .
it 's really important .
so i do n't write a little bit about things .
i 'm also going to tell you a lot of political things .
and i 'm going to ask you , i 'm often asking what i 'm going to do .
and , yes , i 've got this text .
he 's called the title .
my father came from <unk> , and i was in my mother and i 'm going to tell you .
yeah .
we have to be able to be able to do this .
thank you .
yes , i want to make a little advertising .
i ca n't afford to do a business or so , so i 've got to do that .
and i also have to remember , and i also also have to go to a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
you 'd like to go back .
and i 'm going to be , i 'm really <unk> , i 'm really <unk> .
and yeah .
i want to say that i just said .
it 's going on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little advertising i i 've been doing .
feet .
rich , vitamin c .
so the idea is .
vitamin <unk> .
it 's very funny .
i want to be a joke about the <unk> of your friend , but the <unk> was just just flat .
yes , it 's not the <unk> .
and then you have to stop the <unk> of the election , you have to have the <unk> of the <unk> .
yeah .
thank you .
they were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me start with a question .
why do you want to do it ?
i think everybody would be used to be a <unk> , if he could be able to be able to be able to get a <unk> of the society .
the answer is clear .
we know that the life expectancy is only about the age of the birth of the age of the age of cancer .
that means it has to have any environmental impact , which has to have the impact on the quality .
why do we know that ?
why are we going to be <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> , the most part of each other ?
you remember , you remember , the <unk> was found .
it was fat .
you thought , if you eat fat of food , we 're all getting the <unk> and healthy .
what 's going to be on the top of the private <unk> <unk> in the united states , and what has been changed to have the american <unk> that has been a year .
then you said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the <unk> .
what 's going to be the best of the quality of the election , and so on the past , and it 's been on .
so it 's going to be going to be going to be a new new <unk> <unk> , and it 's going to be a <unk> of the <unk> .
where does the all work ?
now , the reason is , for my taste , for the first time , we 've been going to learn to be through three to the <unk> of our own <unk> to share with scientific wisdom .
in example , for a minute , it 's a <unk> .
the <unk> you know .
and in fact , a lot of a lot of a new magazine is a new <unk> .
the top of the top of the year is the highest year for the year .
keith richards was seven years ago .
then the newspaper was the newspaper .
or this lady here .
<unk> .
the oldest man who has ever been on the earth .
and for the age of the age .
i know there 's some people who are saying , they 're going to be six , but they 're not going to find their own .
and he 's actually been really successful .
and she stopped with the <unk> , but with the first time , after the end of the election , we had to go to the path to stop the election and stop smoking .
and she 's got to die .
what does that tell us ?
not that cigarettes are healthy .
but it 's saying that we 're very complicated , and we need to use the <unk> , we need to have a simple experiment , and we have to ask simple questions .
so , a simple question , and a simple amount of things that are in different countries , women are older than men .
what is this ?
we know it .
so that 's the testosterone of the <unk> , which is the male <unk> .
and there 's all the simple evidence for men that are just like women .
now , you can think of yourself , if it 's a security election .
austria is a <unk> country .
but it 's still better , not afraid .
we should have to <unk> ourselves with <unk> <unk> .
it 's complicated , but just to be able to do it .
so , so , there 's a <unk> <unk> , and then you ask , what do you do , they do n't know how much they were doing , and they were so old ?
ah .
the <unk> is every day of cigarettes .
that 's the secret of your child , or ?
and the ten cigarettes is not just the same .
or but they have the <unk> and the <unk> , without the 10 , you 're going to be older .
even hard statistics are not always <unk> .
there 's a lot of examples that are going to be the people that are going to be the most people who are in the <unk> of the <unk> people , as people who do n't do .
<unk> .
it 's <unk> .
is that the consumer ?
no .
it 's that people just just have enough money in the pocket , and they 're at the age of their age .
but if i 'm a group of people , and you have to give them a <unk> , and these group of 20 percent longer than the <unk> , but the only time you have n't ever been able to get , but it 's actually going to be
and actually , they were made .
you have to tell you that the idea is very <unk> , but even though i 'm going to tell my enemies that it 's <unk> that life is not alive .
and this works for the most different organisms .
for example , in the bacteria .
you see this is the <unk> of bacteria .
when we 're working in the <unk> , the <unk> is actually the longer the <unk> .
the same thing for you , you 're going to fly and <unk> , and recently , only about two years ago , it 's actually the same thing that it 's actually known for monkeys .
it 's not about being thin .
it works in the <unk> of the <unk> .
and this is another experiment that was in the united states .
what did you do ?
you 've got to have a <unk> , and that 's the <unk> of the government , so you have to have a lot of education , so you 've got to have a lot of education , and so you 've got to get a lot of time
and who 's the <unk> that we 're <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were very bad , and bad .
now , you 've got to have a lot of time , and the same number of the same number of time was just going to be able to go into the <unk> .
the ones that have no food to eat , for you , you have to eat twice twice as much as much .
and this is the same , and healthy and healthy , and they have no longer .
even though we were <unk> .
both of the same ones .
and the ones that was sick and the other healthy .
what happens ?
it 's a process called <unk> , or it 's <unk> .
whenever they 're living organisms , or cells take it away , it 's the organism to make it in the cell , and using the cell cells to make it energy .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see how in the cell , it 's actually a lot of time , because of the time that 's the time .
the <unk> of the <unk> and the cell will be the <unk> of the cell and the cell as energy .
it 's going to be the same <unk> in the age of the <unk> .
this is the molecular challenge of the consumer , or the most important time of the interest of the time .
so , it 's going to be <unk> , <unk> , life in all sorts of organisms .
and it 's probably that people are working on people .
and we learn that they 're not going to learn how to be in the same time , every little bit of the day , to fight the day .
no .
but they should say , if you have hunger , you might be just the <unk> .
you know , your hunger like a friend .
and that makes sense of meaning .
while we had nine percent of human history , what 's the human beings who did when he had hunger ?
it 's <unk> .
we 're going to go back to the fridge , when we have hungry .
and this is safe to biology .
now , we know , and that 's the bible , in the bible , in the bible , at the last chapter , the mind is <unk> , but the meat is weak .
the garden looks like us .
here 's a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> garden .
the three boys here are good , the food is all the day , and then we 're going to take it .
and that 's the really important thing .
we 've been looking for the design for the <unk> , the molecular answer of the driver 's <unk> .
that might be interesting for people who do n't have to be interested in the best election .
and it might be perhaps a hardest quality of life .
so the question is , we can have the idea that the <unk> , the <unk> , and even though you eat it ?
and we have many hundred hundred years , the thousand <unk> , natural <unk> .
we 've found that in the fact that it 's called the <unk> .
and it 's a substance of that in all organisms , but also in all of the organisms that we have less than the time .
in the skin , it 's the same .
and more people have been significantly more likely to be more than the skin .
and if we 're going to be more human cells , you 'll see this .
this is a <unk> cell .
it 's the <unk> that we 're going to give up and we see a lot of thousands of these little <unk> in the cell , which is the time that the <unk> of the time , and the most of the time .
and the same cells would be quite different .
and that works in all sorts of organisms .
here 's a <unk> for example .
so we 've got to find the molecular impact of the molecular system .
life because the organisms are too much longer .
and the answer is , you see , you see , this is a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
it 's simple .
after the first days , all of the dead days is that the dead days is about half dead .
when we 're going to get to the water , we 're going to be able to get these animals and survive .
we know that human cells are that we have to have the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , in culture , for three years , as long as we can get them .
and the latest research is also going to be close to the life of the life of all of us in the <unk> .
and it 's not just the life , it 's also the norm .
and these are really <unk> .
so .
now , you know , all of you know , where is it going to be ?
as the name is , it 's been the <unk> , it 's been in very high .
but i can also be able to be able to be able to open up in the <unk> green <unk> , <unk> cheese , and a product of the <unk> , which is in japan , which is really important to be a lot of <unk> , so that
we have to say , if everyone does help , it 's actually helping it to help it , but it does n't need to be true for the future ?
you need to know that the common denominator of all of the heart is that the most successful <unk> of the brain is in the brain .
and we did experiments in the experiments .
they 're going to be wondering , we have to make the <unk> <unk> .
flies , because they 're going to be <unk> , when they 're old .
they have more more than they 're going to be old .
and the molecular mechanisms that are important for memory is the same way to do people .
now , you ask , how the devil is the <unk> of the memory of the <unk> ?
this is the experiment we 've done with <unk> <unk> of the university of berlin .
you take a hundred fruit flies and there 's a <unk> that you love .
and it 's true .
and let 's go in this <unk> <unk> .
then they take the same fly , they 're going to go into the next chamber and give them the other <unk> , they love that .
we 're going to do it , but they 're going to work with the same time .
the classic <unk> .
then they take the same fly , and they 're going to do this .
the <unk> goes down to the <unk> , and you see it .
and if you 're here , there are a side of the side and other side of the other side .
where do you go ?
yeah .
the <unk> .
except the two here .
that 's the <unk> .
or , we say , you have character .
i love my job and i do n't want to do it with the <unk> reward .
okay .
but it 's also a character of character that 's older .
not just fly .
and we could actually actually have the <unk> of the <unk> to be a more <unk> , and a more <unk> time .
and the <unk> that was in the brain were <unk> .
that means , not only , but it 's not just about cancer , but also , for the disease , maybe .
and that 's important because we want to do that not the world 's largest <unk> of the world .
it does n't make sense that the time of the time .
and i do n't want to leave you , without even a few of the <unk> tips we might have to be younger .
even more time .
it 's not about that you lose weight or so .
there 's a lot of <unk> in austria , a group of people who eat a day and a day .
this is the so-called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the very good thing is that it 's very good .
it 's the means that it 's .
you have to do it .
it 's not about conventional complex carbs , not even dangerous .
it 's really like candy .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to be <unk> ,
and you know , that sugar can produce the growth of tumors .
here 's the <unk> that you 're going to see in the front of the time .
after 30 days , the dead are dead .
it 's very low to the glucose of the brain .
to make a more <unk> effect .
there 's just a example that works in almost all of these organisms .
eat them regularly , vegetables .
you get the gift of a lot of interest , or for all of the time .
you know , you know , you know , and you can have cancer .
that 's not under circumstances for vitamin d .
we 're now going to be <unk> in the winter of the <unk> , because vitamin d is sunlight by sunlight .
some of you at least three times a week , which is trivial .
cigarettes , the first three of the <unk> , for 10 years , for 10 years , for 15 years .
they 're in the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> .
the impact of the <unk> and blood pressure is about the life .
because monks of life almost like women .
and more importantly , more than the more successful , more than the <unk> .
and more than the more than the <unk> .
but more importantly , more than the more than ever .
only more than the first time , we die .
what is this ?
people think that 's what 's going to do with some <unk> .
no , it 's just simple .
now , if you have a <unk> on the window , i 've been going to get the same way to go to the <unk> .
and what happens in your <unk> .
and it 's <unk> , and what 's going to be , by <unk> , in terms of circumstances .
it 's because it has been <unk> , all of the <unk> .
a <unk> partner or a family is associated with longevity .
they do n't have to be a lot of road on the road .
now , you think it 's going to be true .
but that 's not what we do with nothing .
it 's about <unk> .
you can measure the closer to a lot of the street , which is more than the <unk> .
and then he said , `` i 've got to get it out .
i can do good and the noise does n't do anything .
not .
he has more more than the blood and it 's bad .
and sunlight , we should be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
we know that it 's very good , the <unk> effects .
it 's all the way it 's going to be able to do it .
and we know that we know that we know , and we 're using diseases of diseases .
the way we had to do is the best of our grandmothers , and we 've got to have the same time .
not without sense .
several studies that we have to make sure that dark chocolate can be <unk> .
recently recently , a beautiful study that shows that that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a day , which has a day to be able to get a <unk> of the time .
so , what 's the same thing you 're doing is the <unk> of coffee , but you 're <unk> .
there are studies that show these studies that are not showing .
what is that , that 's <unk> , for diabetes , and therefore your metabolic performance .
and coffee is also a good job because he 's going to be able to work with the <unk> of the <unk> of paris .
so , a very beautiful and <unk> study in the hundred years of years , people have been shown for that people who have been able to get every day , and they 're going to eat their daily kids , their two percent .
this is a huge value for the <unk> .
and this is for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , three , more , more .
but not the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
the only thing you 're going to do is just like you 're going to go to the same , ok ?
but it 's actually not beans .
so for peanuts , it 's not the way .
the next point is a little bit a little bit .
avoid the shot of a lot of animal protein , so meat and <unk> , but only if you 're between the <unk> and three years old .
so , a very nice new study that they 're looking at when they were in this time to make a lot of animal proteins , they 're going to take their more much more than if they were a strong sample .
that 's not for the time that the animal are <unk> and it 's not for the poor children or teenagers , and they have the animal supply , and it 's not pregnant for pregnant and that they want to be .
i think it 's going to be more effective .
whatever they do , they know , they know , <unk> , who said , `` the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the health .
all of the <unk> is in the <unk> .
this is the gentleman that 's been <unk> for the <unk> of this regime , and he 's been married for the age of his age .
he comes from my home to the first time , never sick .
and he 's very good .
he 's not not a <unk> , but he 's in a private society , where it 's a lot of healthy people .
he has been talking about the <unk> that i told you today .
we should have all the time to do the first experiments , not not there .
and that 's that that means that the most of the drugs is not a biological social system , and it 's a social way , and it 's going to be a <unk> .
you have to be the old people and that could be a <unk> of our culture .
and the biggest novel was the biggest novel of the year was a year of death .
the brothers .
a work , which was the most <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i 'm going to do .
a question where nobody is to have a <unk> , because it 's a little bit of a little bit of you who are lonely ?
the transportation is very low .
when i thought it was .
but it 's probably not why they were not aware of the people that they were interested in the most important .
many people are <unk> and loneliness and think of the future .
it 's not the case .
and it 's a <unk> view of a phenomenon of people than being alone .
maybe it 's not because they 're not saying that the question is <unk> .
feel you feel lonely or you 're lonely ?
you can feel lonely without being lonely .
and you can be lonely without being able to feel a little bit lonely .
loneliness has to do a lot of shame .
and so that 's a few years ago , to be a <unk> of <unk> .
loneliness is shame and shame .
loneliness .
so , there 's no one of these things that i 've been told you have to have .
loneliness need to be .
loneliness , the time to be aware of their own .
and loneliness to the exercise , you can talk about it .
and this exercise we do n't have to do it .
we do n't have the language of the language we have to see ourselves as a result , and when we 're lonely ?
there 's an <unk> two of the time i 've always been coming back .
the one part of humanity says , you 're just beginning to be lonely .
and the birth of death is just lonely .
there are some moments in life where you can get the best .
and these people go to the same time , and they 're going to get the whole day .
i did n't have a time , so it 's so much .
and then there 's people , there 's less , the most important thing , all of it is all connected .
so i do n't have to do it , so i 'm just part of the big universe .
and there 's the big group of the time that i think of the time .
so , the think , i 'm going to be lonely , and the next day , it 's all together .
when we think about loneliness , we think that 's a great story of a <unk> .
the loneliness of the death of the <unk> is a intensive care of the person .
but about this , that 's what i 'm talking about , this is not the great privilege of all , but i want to talk about the little bit about the little bit about the <unk> , which is a <unk> in the theater of a theater .
i do n't want to talk about the burden of burden and the quality of the security .
loneliness to other people , not often is not a benign violation of us .
the <unk> christine <unk> <unk> in the morning a few photos i want to show you .
how easily it keeps us to be more loneliness to the other loneliness .
and we do n't know if these people really really feel in this moment .
but who does n't know that the moment in the moment of thinking , if you think about all , you 're all about the rest of the corner , and nobody has to be in the corner .
this suddenly is all of the <unk> <unk> .
maybe you 've been already aware of it .
what you do is you can put the cell phone , you can see it , you can see it in the same way , that the <unk> is going to be a <unk> of the cell .
so clearly , you see the screen .
what we do n't do here .
yes , and then there 's the loneliness of the story that 's a <unk> of a <unk> of a moment of <unk> , and you have a chance of <unk> in the hope , and you have to leave yourself in the hope that you ca n't forget
that 's the most important thing that you see from the outside .
we 're going to give people other people .
but i 'm sure there 's a lot of people in the room who are taught by the <unk> of the life that you 've spent their entire life in their life , by trying to have this loneliness of interest , and they 're going to be <unk>
and there 's in this room , you know , people are being taught , because they 're on a other person , because it 's about death or a <unk> .
there 's nothing that 's also more people , people who are connected to them , they 're feeling they feel lonely .
and there are people who have lost their own selves , and they 're not lonely .
i 'm going to have the digital loneliness .
and sit on the <unk> loneliness .
the <unk> loneliness is familiar .
these are people who are going to be in their opinion , for a social contacts .
it 's still relatively relatively .
there 's no <unk> number , no any number of people , if someone has enough to do a little human , when you do n't know .
and we 're going to get the old people in the old people .
it 's the <unk> form of loneliness .
since we all live in cities , with many people in facebook or facebook or facebook , or facebook is a digital loneliness of the bigger .
you can be connected to hundreds of people to be connected with a single people .
it 's the activity of the <unk> of human relationships , which is the <unk> of the digital loneliness of the relationship .
the two forms of loneliness is very often about each other .
this is also the <unk> loneliness of a little <unk> <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness is good for the <unk> and <unk> .
it 's the digital loneliness in the future of the future , more than the opportunity to connect to each other .
i do n't know if you 're in 20 years of this sense of our view , this is a <unk> of our <unk> , is a <unk> .
or whether you have to find a new term .
but these are also the problems of the <unk> generation .
almost more than the loneliness itself is fear of loneliness and fear of fear of loneliness , people are willing to do a lot of people .
and the great thing , the great interest , has a more successful person has been a wonderful idea .
in the way they 're doing what people do n't do .
they build a <unk> , they have children who are trained and <unk> .
but the idea is n't <unk> to the fear of the loneliness , which is money .
<unk> .
things .
and the process of the process is , because it 's not a <unk> of the <unk> , as the objects that you have .
problem is just that it 's very easy to be , and it 's this <unk> <unk> against the loneliness .
so we have to have new things to be new .
i 've got the advertising for a single country .
and the most important thing is to be all of the mobile phone 's <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
what do you do with the <unk> , you know , but it 's also the same thing .
loneliness is nothing to do with the <unk> of a <unk> , which is not like it .
and the first thing has been a wonderful poem , and there 's a verse of the worst is the loneliness of the <unk> .
hand , who does n't know ?
in a relationship or the other and the other time , and suddenly , and suddenly , really , awful lonely , awful lonely and the question is that the person is actually going to be ?
i do n't want to do anything with anything ?
one study that is to tell us about the <unk> women , married , children , feel like children .
and the evidence is because i do n't have to know that i 've been going to have a lot of time that i 've been told , because i 've been told you 've been told .
but it 's not quite important because it 's at least the same time , and the reaction is that the people are going to be in the most people .
that 's the same thing that 's almost a <unk> , almost a bit of it .
loneliness is a little bit of , and yet we do n't talk about them .
so , i think about the loneliness of sex .
and that 's probably probably everybody else .
even while you 're thinking , you 're thinking about what i do ?
who is this person in my bed ?
also , the form of loneliness is not necessarily what we have to do with the quality of the sexual experience .
nothing to do with the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we 're not talking about them because we 're not looking at it .
we 're not just talking about the workforce .
in the workforce , the most important thing is that we think about the economy .
i was <unk> in the same time , and i 've got a group of five , and i 've got to be three , three <unk> , and two <unk> .
the two men have been talking about the two women in the world .
and in between , something else has to be in the hand of the hand .
i do n't have to do that with you , but you do n't have to do this shape of loneliness that everyone has been ever seen in his life .
it 's the loneliness of the <unk> .
it 's also the loneliness of the <unk> .
we know all the time , and i see , maybe you 're going to be able to tell you the rest of your life .
in fact , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , you 're not going to do the lot of you , who are actually what they 're doing .
where they 're sitting on .
it 's a form of loneliness that 's not going to be talking about .
only as it is , it 's also as a benign <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
so here 's <unk> .
i 've been told that he was told by a clients who was told by a clients , and who said , it 's what happened , you ca n't imagine it .
one was in the lunchroom .
it 's actually the <unk> for the <unk> .
and two months later , he 's also going to be able to see it .
the loneliness is never alone .
they always feel connected with other feelings .
they have beautiful siblings and they have ugly siblings .
the <unk> of the <unk> , we know all .
fear , grief despair and shame .
but we should also have the beautiful siblings .
the freedom of the desire is to be the desire .
so , my favorite point is , the loneliness of the <unk> .
and it 's coming in the life like the <unk> and <unk> .
let 's do it , and you do n't take them .
because there 's a lot more worse than the loneliness and the emptiness , which is the <unk> of the loneliness , if you do n't have anything more .
loneliness is part of life .
since i 've been thinking about a lot of loneliness , i 've been thinking about two things .
and in my <unk> , i 'm not going to have a lot of my <unk> , i 've been not like a <unk> dictator i 've been told , because i was n't told anyone to do it , because i was n't afraid of people , i
i 've been since since i 've been ever since my life , i 've been going to go to my life , and let 's go to the way .
so that 's what you 're doing with the <unk> that you 're doing .
i 'm going to be free .
people come to and go to the way they 're trying to do more more than a <unk> , or a <unk> of a relationship or a partnership .
as a child , i was my parents .
and the ones that ca n't have to do with any <unk> with someone with a conversation .
whether in the economy , it 's in the economy .
every time it was <unk> .
as a child , i found that as a <unk> .
as young , i 've been able to have it to be incredibly important to have this openness .
but i 've been thinking about myself with the loneliness , and i 'm going to be able to go to my own and also to get my friends .
you see it 's really lonely to be ready for the next door .
thank you .
yeah , thank you .
i 've got three <unk> out of three .
one of a sudden a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now , i ask you if you just have a chance of what you would do , you would take it ?
most of the most people would decide for the election .
and this is a pretty good idea .
and why ?
because we 've got to do the same impact in the effect .
and in health , we do n't think that 's kind of different .
so we 're going to do the same thing that 's completely different , and we 're going to give us to other strategies .
we decide for example , for example , for the sake of sports , and the security is for sports .
great , but big effort .
so i 'm not so valuable .
or we decide for the election .
it 's for diet .
but very much , but still very much effort .
so i 'm not so valuable .
and i want to tell you how you 're going to do with the best effort to be the most important .
if you 're with prevention and health , you 're not going to do a topic .
and the theme is , <unk> .
and the theme of the problem was in germany , not a topic about that , so it 's about the <unk> .
and then the number of people in germany are in germany .
and i wondered what was the right ?
why was that so much about the top ?
and then i 've been working on research and i 've been <unk> .
because it was exactly the same time .
what was there ?
and there was all over germany .
and we 're always going to get always the same ?
and i looked at the <unk> .
and it 's going to be <unk> for germany .
and that 's the rate .
and in the years , the curve is going to go back to the right time .
and what happens after germany ?
and everyone and more and more and more and more , and how it 's all .
and we 're always going to get always the same ?
well , i have one one , and one of the one .
because it was clear .
sports is dick .
and of course , i do n't want to tell you that sports is a little bit thick .
because that 's not true .
but one of us have been discovered .
the <unk> of the <unk> , and not to have the <unk> , and we have n't been able to get better and healthier .
so what 's it ?
the diet ?
and there 's a lot of great study of the united states .
and the problem is that the problem is .
and they 've got to be in the workforce .
and then you wanted to look at what happens , what happens ?
and you 've seen that people are actually eating less fat , but they 're still going to eat less calories , but still still .
and this was paradox .
and so they 've got to call it .
we can explain that ?
you can have the body of the body .
so we 've got this little bit of <unk> .
and on the side of a side , we 're going to do the whole <unk> , which is going to be <unk> .
and here 's the energy <unk> of the electricity .
if we 're now more <unk> in our power , we 're going to put the energy on the ground , and it 's the energy power of power and it 's <unk> .
the human body does n't have the same bang .
the energy can save the energy .
and it 's in form of fat .
our greatest and three security .
what happens when we have less than we heard , energy and yet , even more energy , it 's just a end of the way .
the income has increased dramatically .
there 's no life in the way .
we 're just going to grow up .
and that 's what happens .
our grandparents are still two miles to walk .
and we 're going to go down to a two miles , and these are the positive estimates .
there are studies that are talking about five -- until the <unk> .
i 've got to tell you that one of my friend mike <unk> .
you can give me a little bit of the chair ?
mike , you 're going to be <unk> ?
mike 's americans .
he 's shy , he 's not going to talk about it .
and he was at this study , and here 's this story .
he 's this <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he has to be <unk> , and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike eat less and less and less and still still , and yet it 's always always the same .
why ?
because mike 's only sitting .
and i watched the way that much <unk> mike was so much and then he took him back to the next step back in the pocket and the evening .
and there 's a thousand steps .
so that was the distance that mike <unk> from the morning in the car , with the car in the office , in the office , you would get a little coffee back and back back back back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
this is mike , this day was 10 minutes on his legs .
and for hours , and fifty minutes , he was mike or mike .
under this conditions , the disease is alone .
and mike 's not because he 's too much because he 's too much better , because it 's still going to get the energy of it , but it 's not always it 's always the energy and the energy .
and first , the energy is to see the energy that you see .
but energy is not the ones that 's not there .
the first time to go back to the first door .
and also , it 's active and <unk> and quiet .
so the blood sugar .
so if the energy gets to the blood , they 're going to be the doctors and high school .
and this blood , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , all these holes in this room .
and a happiness is still the whole fat and this is the little wounds and we 're talking about the little wounds and we 're talking about it .
and now , the heart is right under pressure , because it 's going to be the blood through these <unk> , and we 're talking about hypertension .
and if this treatment is going to be a <unk> , it 's also the body .
and when the heart is , we call the heart .
and when it 's going to turn the head , we call the stroke .
and also in germany , every second , heart disease and stroke .
that means , in germany , every second , every second .
and so so mike does n't get so much because he does n't get a sports , but because he does n't even move it .
and if you do n't know that , you 're going to be wrong with the wrong spot .
for example , the topic is a diet .
i 've got a little bit of <unk> , in the <unk> , and there 's a lot of <unk> , and there 's a lot of time to be more successful .
and if every book just just a <unk> dick and we would be the next , we 'd have to be a 30 meters high to the <unk> of the <unk> .
and i 've been reading the time .
and there 's actually the reason that it 's really important when you 're more than you 're going to use more energy than you 're going to eat it .
and if you use less energy than you 're going to use it .
this is brilliant .
but why do we need to be able to do this ?
it 's just a end of the end .
the need is , of course , it 's not a help .
because why is a diet a diet ?
because it 's a diet , not a lifestyle .
what are the things that we 're doing for three weeks and five weeks ago when we go to this , and then we get to the normal day , in the normal life , we 're going to make our normal lifestyle .
what 's going to be five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except , and then , again , i would have a <unk> in the confidence that we did n't have done that we 've done .
so you can imagine today today , every new diet , and you can want to be able to be able to do your life , and you want to be able to make your life in your life .
yes , no ?
and if you go .
and if you do n't just stay .
because if the end of the end is nothing , it 's not a <unk> .
it 's the habits that we 're getting sick or healthy .
it 's the bad habits that we 're sick .
and it 's the good habits that we make healthy .
and when mike in the mirror looks at the mirror , he looks at the result of his daily lifestyle .
if mike in the mirror , he looks like his everyday habits .
and if mike in the mirror , it 's also going to be the way he 's going to see it .
because if he 's more bad habits , it 's just the way it 's going to be in the way .
and when mike is going to go towards the direction of the future , his dreams , he does n't have to be able to be able to make his entire life .
and then he takes just more good habits than bad .
and a <unk> <unk> mike is a great example of that human animal is a weird animal .
mike , it 's made for example , it 's almost <unk> by his daily life , by the car , every car , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and i sat on the couch , and you have to go back to the couch , and you have to go back to the movement .
so he 's going to go into his <unk> , with the <unk> , which is going to be a <unk> , and then you 're going to be able to be able to see the <unk> of the <unk> , and then it 's like a <unk> <unk>
and my grandpa would have been just like the same as you .
the <unk> was a <unk> and did n't understand it .
the <unk> , i said , `` well , you ca n't move to the people .
and somehow it 's pretty much .
why do we have to put in our precious time that we 've been going to do the life in the life ?
so , i 'd like to have this idea of this today , for a better lifestyle , a day .
but it 's just a lot easier to find the movement where we lost it .
in the daily life .
and so i 'm going to talk to you today today .
maybe you know , you know , you know , you 're going to take the situation , you 'll go to the first time , and you 're going to go to the first time you 're not a place .
and it 's what you 're looking at as a <unk> of this room .
we want to get the way to go .
we 're going to build our homes that we 've been looking at the best way .
we 're going to make our whole life that we 've been doing that we have to do the future , but we do n't have to go out where we need .
but in a different direction .
so , you can get it to the same time , and the movement is going to find out where they 're going to go .
i like to do this for the <unk> .
and i 'm the only ones that goes down and down and down and down and all other .
but when i 've been still , i 'm going to be a time for me .
and i 'm going to have the movement that 's just going to be a little bit of it .
and when the <unk> comes up , 30 minutes , i say , `` i 'm <unk> . ''
so , some steps .
that 's about three times 10 minutes .
and a <unk> <unk> steps if you 're going to take a day of extra steps , and that 's the end of the day you 're 12 pounds of fat in your body .
so , maybe you might be pretty much sound .
but as a <unk> , as a <unk> , it 's time , for three days , we 're going to talk about four five pounds of fat .
we do n't have our body .
and you give me to the point of that , i 'll get it to the moment .
the americans are crazy , what 's going to be here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds .
and i 'm going to be four pounds .
just you see what happens with these little steps .
and if the effect is from this perspective , what 's what you 're doing when you really have a active life .
and that 's the moment you get every day in your daily life .
once you 're going to get a day , you 're going to get all of the <unk> , you 're going to get all of these disorders of the brain .
and if you go and then , you 're going to go on the top , you 're going to go on the top .
and then you have to be married with the highest election .
then they 're going to grow faster and stronger .
but they do n't do their health , not on sports .
so they do n't do their health on their own , and they 're their time .
because the most important thing is that you 're going to make every day than lifestyle .
and i 've got to support a active lifestyle .
and for me , it 's more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a life that 's safe for life and for me .
because i think , health do n't do what we should do .
but health is what we want to do .
and so i 'm just going to give you a idea for you .
they just just want to be just the best .
and you know , it 's like it .
step forward .
thank you .
and what 's really leonardo in the fact , it 's actually a leonardo da vinci , it 's actually amazing , and how the world can see the world with other eyes ?
and so , in fact , what was the way that we had to do , what was the time just just <unk> ?
could we do something like this ?
so what did we do with the <unk> ?
and how can we do it , and <unk> for our future ?
let 's start with the question of what we do is what we 're doing in innovation ?
yeah .
technology inventions and development even even the government of the government , the government has the government .
so i really understand it .
that 's all great .
and we can be proud of that , and grateful that we 're going to be in these many areas of these world , that we 've been going to be able to be able to be able to be doing it .
so we 've been doing this extraordinary unique technology .
but how does it look like the future ?
what challenges are there to be a society ?
and who cares about the big ecological social social challenges ?
so , it seems to be a way to be going to be a little bit .
a kind of <unk> .
so the economy of the ecological challenges because the entrepreneurs are doing the huge effort to increase productivity and efficiency .
and the world is better to do the world in the <unk> organizations and <unk> and <unk> and the government , so what we need to do is to be able to go to the <unk> of the economy of the economy of the economy .
at least , we 're trying to fix it .
but who says , `` what we 've got to do is that we have to look at the whole way ?
how would we be going to be our <unk> social social system ?
if technological innovation are also cultural innovation ?
if economic innovation are also social innovation ?
if it could be used to be able to make people and <unk> , and we can do the solutions to the solution of social challenges ?
if you have to be more familiar with the other forces , and if it 's a different , you can be able to do a lot of other things , and then it 's going to be a lot of time ?
because how did it ?
both sides were , or what companies do , or ?
can you do that ?
you might be wondering .
we have to have the same thing as a contradiction .
fortunately , there are examples of examples .
muhammad yunus has been working with his <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> , a lot of poverty in bangladesh .
and interestingly , we have to be more much more than the <unk> of the government who has been working in the government .
and he has to be more than entrepreneurs who had been successful for the nobel prize .
and in the opportunity , i 'm going to give you a little bit of you , i 'm going to do something with someone else .
and i can be able to do the <unk> .
and the <unk> is a very young guy .
great , but also , it has been his ideals .
and yeah , it 's totally true .
i like to do it .
and if you look at the look , you think , you think , you 're going to do the offspring , we need to do our future .
yes , the way he started to work in the university of the <unk> , and we 're going to work in a second medical center .
it makes it good .
it 's really good , and it 's very successful .
and yet something else is there .
so he does n't have to be there , so , that 's what i 'm going to do ?
so this is what the <unk> says , he 's always going to be .
and they are all in the <unk> .
and that 's what it looks like .
and he would also like to be able to do this .
so the right thing that has been the best thing that he has to see is the same thing .
so he does n't know it 's true , but it 's the <unk> of the <unk> .
and there 's the middle of the middle of the <unk> , three <unk> did n't know .
so , more than he was surprised by the time he had been interested in the first time .
as <unk> .
and as a <unk> entrepreneur , he had a <unk> .
so the great joy , so , with young people , he can be able to make his experience .
and the two , you found it found .
and they 've got more time .
how would it be in this one of those conversations that are going to be a little bit of the two ?
so , yeah , so , the thing that was , because it was exactly the same thing .
what is the difference between between consumers and private companies ?
i did n't have to understand that .
yes , <unk> , we 're still going to start with the question of what 's going to be <unk> ?
so , he 's called it .
traditional markets , <unk> products , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , there 's a story .
and you can also be able to be able to give the <unk> of the <unk> , where the big shapes .
and it 's also better , if you can be able to do it , it 's also the same thing .
what is it going to be a private ?
so , <unk> , you know , you know , you know , it 's not a little bit of it , not the little copy of a big company .
it 's something else .
it 's a completely different character .
because it 's not all the time .
no <unk> customers , no longer , nothing , nothing .
so , this is a <unk> organization that has to be a business system for a business system , which is , for example , , but it 's actually , but it 's really <unk> , and it 's going to be a <unk> .
and you 're sure that it 's all of the way that it 's in the way that we have to have more different kinds of other things , but other different ways , to all other other ways .
yeah , that 's clear .
but what are we going to do ?
so , i 'm going to go on , and then you go to the moment it 's going to be more money to make money better ?
so i 've got to be able to get it out , that 's pretty good , so , in berlin , i would recommend you that i would recommend it ?
that 's what 's called the <unk> .
how you have your business successful and for the quality of your life .
oh no .
right ?
what do you think if you 're going to start with the first 30 money , what 's going to be after your consumer ?
so , you 're going to be a career as active , or what ?
what happens with your engagement , so how i know ?
and also , we 're looking at the same time .
so the statistics about you do n't give you a <unk> perspective , because 70 percent of all of the last few years is a lot of the financial crisis in a much more than the big bang .
money is always the result of a successful company and a good business company .
it 's a energy for the energy of the system .
and it 's the basis of economic growth .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , what is the goal ?
the company ?
so when i do what i 've done , i 've been not going to have a way to do it , not a way of the right .
and so , goals , we have to be always aware of the way that we 're going to be on and so forth .
and if i do n't have that , so i do n't know what i do is i do n't know what i 'm looking for ?
so that does n't make me good feeling .
so how i do , and the risks that 's going to be happy for me , and i 'm sure that 's why i 'm going to be <unk> .
yes , <unk> welcome to the <unk> .
but i 've got to be there .
a thread .
so , so , you 've got to be <unk> , so you 've got to be <unk> .
successful generation of generation of generation .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , how do you want to talk ?
i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i 'm going to be interested ?
so we 're going to say , `` well , we 're going to get more .
and in the future , and <unk> and <unk> , sustainable uncertainty .
so , it helps us .
i can give you one of them .
okay .
yes , thank you , <unk> .
but there 's just a question on it .
that can be a very important way to think of the important cultural system .
can we get the time that i can get the other time to get the better way ?
so the first thing is , what i want to do here is what i want to do ?
yes , <unk> , it 's going to be the <unk> of you , and you 're going to go to you , that 's how you can yourself ?
what do you do in the world ?
what are people doing when they work with them ?
what are you ready to do ?
what are your inner , maybe , maybe , even though , are we going to be able to do it ?
why is that important to see that ?
because that 's also their <unk> .
and how did we learn that ?
if you do a ship , you do n't want to do the men together with the <unk> , they 're a hot <unk> , but they 're looking for the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
yeah , good .
so i 'm going to ask the next questions .
what is my job ?
what does that mean ?
yes , <unk> , you can have your target .
so , you can see the details , but i 'm going to tell you you 're going to be a little bit of you , you want to be going to be going to stay on you .
you know , you know , you know , the story of the pink elephant ?
it 's going to be a little bit of it .
not ?
in the middle .
so , you know , go .
you do n't have a pink elephant .
okay ?
it 's what it 's done ?
so there 's no pink elephants .
did it ?
no pink elephant .
see you ?
so we 're going to focus on that we 're not going to do that .
what is the only way ?
so , it 's about it ?
yeah , yeah , you can tell you what you want .
so , the <unk> , or maybe the <unk> of the <unk> .
but imagine it 's a little bit .
by the way , what i do is you want to do it , but it 's going to be true ?
i 've got a couple of years .
and if you have the <unk> .
and in fact , in the case , we 're called <unk> <unk> smith .
who 's the <unk> ?
at least , three percent of our efforts has to be more likely to die with death with death .
i need to spend more of the time to pay attention to their first time to spend the time in the time , for the time , for the moment , the first time ,
i 'm going to put the glass in the <unk> .
i 've got to tell you three more important , sir , sir .
and i 've been going to tell my attention to the private election .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
oh , i 'm going to do it in the morning ?
and <unk> , as you need to have three , you need to be more important to have a more important value for the future .
and the <unk> is coming from .
it 's just a <unk> of the <unk> .
the real quality is more important to be more important ?
and <unk> like it ?
what did you notice ?
has changed something ?
okay .
okay , and the flower .
okay .
so , then we look at the time , we see the bear .
and the problem is .
and in fact , in the case , we 're called <unk> <unk> smith .
who 's the <unk> ?
at least , three percent of our efforts has to be more likely to die with death with death .
i need to spend more of the time to pay attention to their first time to spend the time in the time .
i 'm going to put the glass in the <unk> .
i 've got to tell you three more important , sir , sir .
and i 've been going to tell my attention to the private election .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> , how do you do it ?
so i know , i was shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i saw the first time .
i thought it could n't be .
and even more , i was when i was going to be through the head of the head , it 's actually going to be the whole time that i was going to do the entire time ?
through my life .
and okay , i understand that makes it completely sense .
and the immediate <unk> of the <unk> is that most of our perception and our primary first have got to be <unk> .
but what 's happening ?
what i did , i was what i did ?
and so , the <unk> , you can see your perception to be able to be able to be able to be able to make more important more important .
well , yes , thank you , but then we 'll ask the next question .
how could i get to my target ?
so , i think i think i can make good good question .
and i 'm going to ask you , i 'm not going to do it , and i do n't know it 's not a way .
yes , <unk> , there 's good news for you .
that 's going to be easier as you might have seen it .
because if you have your mind , your inner device and if you 're going to give you a little bit , you have to be able to be able to see it , and you 'll be able to get it in the middle of the room .
almost automatically .
you 're not going to do it as a piece of a piece of things that you 're going to do .
this is the famous <unk> that you 've got in the morning .
and so , i mean , i think you can see the way you see you can see you who you can ask you to ask you to be able to get more <unk> , and then you get to get more <unk> .
and you have a big model .
the <unk> is the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , if you did n't know , it was the <unk> of the <unk> in florence .
for lunch , the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , politicians , politicians , <unk> , architects , and he 's <unk> , very intense <unk> .
but not in our future , where it 's going to be , who 's going to be <unk> ?
who 's right ?
but it 's actually been that all of these different things that were happening in the way that they were not able to be able to be able to be able to do anything like it could be able to be able to be able to do anything .
well , well , the next question is what 's going to do the next question ?
<unk> , there are a successful entrepreneur in the reason .
instead of planning to be a little bit and <unk> and so forth , they just just keep the next step .
because what do you do with uncertainty ?
but the <unk> is very determined and with all of the consequences .
and if it 's nothing , dan can take it to the other step .
and even if the big , you have to do all , it 's not a little bit of it , it 's going to be a little other .
so it 's important that you 're going to be aware of your mind .
that 's the inner security .
and in the rest of how we 've learned all of us ?
although we did n't know , and it did n't have any <unk> ?
and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
so , this kind of <unk> learning , and this is what we 're doing , and this is also a lot of <unk> , that 's a lot of fun that it 's in a company in a business system .
and this is also the kind of <unk> that makes us feel more difficult to make it .
yes , thank you .
so that sounds pretty good .
but i do n't know , i know , i know , i 've got to have a lot of <unk> , because there 's something that 's going to happen .
and even in germany , there 's always this <unk> mood .
and i think , there was the politicians who have to change that .
okay , my boy , come up .
like the water , it 's going to be the water .
what do you think how many people can change ?
ten ?
tens of thousands ?
ten million ?
look at this .
who can you see ?
right .
that 's the change you can change .
or to be <unk> , the change of the world is looking for the world in the world .
think you think , nice words and big models , but how do it work ?
and we have to be lucky to be the lucky ones for our election .
so , for all of us , in all of the crises , if you 're looking at a little bit of crisis , if you 're too little , you 're going to be a little bit of you , and you have to do them with you
and if you ask you to ask you , what you 're going to do with you , you know , you 're going to ask you to you , you know , you can see your posture , you can feel better .
ask you , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to get you to you .
and you know , `` you ask , you know , you know , what you 're doing is that this crisis , or what happened is that it 's happening .
so i mean , if you 've got it , it 's worth it .
yeah .
thank you .
and you really think that i can do this for my own way ?
yeah .
and you see , you know , two things .
first , the <unk> of the <unk> of your inner <unk> is to be part of their <unk> .
because that 's what 's true of perception .
and the second , you see , your inner attitude is to be in the inner way .
because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
future , if we 're going to change our own perception .
so you do that ?
yeah , i think you 've got .
thank you .
all good <unk> .
yeah .
what do you think of our <unk> ?
nice .
really , or , right ?
and how do we think that we 're going to be right now ?
is this a new job ?
i mean , yeah .
it 's very clear .
and i see that in the front of the time .
it 's called <unk> <unk> .
and that 's what the really important thing is .
one of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
and no , so , new , <unk> .
that 's the <unk> .
the only time in the big famous name is the great <unk> .
from robert <unk> , by the <unk> , <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or they 're all the <unk> .
let 's just try to make this mind .
and who may be , perhaps , the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> of our time .
you see , i 'm going to be <unk> .
so maybe i would be able to do that i 'm going to teach kids and their future , because we are the future of our future .
instead , the most of the most time i 'm doing is all of the time .
i spent a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i have the program to <unk> entrepreneurship , <unk> .
we need to be <unk> , that means you can make your life in the garbage or find your own way you can do it in the workplace .
why am i so so so much about the most important thing that you 've ever been doing ?
our program is not really easy to understand how programs are going to teach children .
and frankly , i thought that the last one of the last place is in the universe that i would work .
what believe you think is the most important factor of childhood people with the people who work with ?
we 've found that there are positive models often often be positive models .
and if you think about it , why is it in a lot of more and many of the lot of many people often have n't been there that he 's not a good work that he 's convinced that he 's <unk> or he 's <unk> in prison
and when then a young boy is about what he might do , he might not have to be able to do a better idea as a different life , because he did n't have a better role .
and he 's going to be his father .
i 'm going to introduce you to martin luther .
martin is the program .
his father was a <unk> and made the whole family of hell .
when he was 12 , he had his mother died and he had his little brother to go home .
there was the great <unk> of the great .
he was shy and and so the perfect victim .
until the day as a little brother , a little bit of it is on the ground , it 's the floor .
and then he <unk> martin , the first time he was going to go to the <unk> and he said .
and then it was <unk> .
and so it went to it .
violence was in his life as his father .
how do you just have the same thing , i 'm going to do it ?
after childhood , the youth are a lot of unemployed or have a lot of <unk> .
they do n't know much different than their illegal activities and their <unk> .
and then you will get a day in prison , where you 're going to be the same way that you 're going to do the same way that you 're not going to do a better role .
what think about what you think , people are in prison , if you 're in prison ?
most of you do n't know much good .
and they 're going to be better criminals in the workforce .
they sell drugs to be a higher level and where they 're going to be able to stay in the hospital .
and that 's the <unk> in germany , in germany .
this means , in germany , he will be <unk> by the <unk> of the world .
but then there 's also people in prison who really want to change .
but also these people wear a <unk> <unk> .
and there 's the <unk> .
and everywhere you come , it 's the first identity .
whether you 're looking at a workplace , whether you 're looking at a place for new jobs , you 're going to be with this identity , with this identity , which is a <unk> society that you have to make a society in society .
this is the problem that we 're going to stand .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what do you think , you have to do a lot of <unk> ?
they 're surprised .
it 's <unk> skills .
who has been a <unk> <unk> , definitely , of course , has been definitely about three , and it 's about the <unk> .
only the thing that has been on the issue is a little bit of , because it 's not in prison .
these properties want to be a positive device .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three .
we 're going to share the basic <unk> of entrepreneurship and economy .
every people have to be their own business , and everyone takes a <unk> part of a <unk> .
and then we also also have the people who are working in the workplace , who 's the most important relationship with their personal relationships and also a different bit of a different relationship .
what 's the <unk> of the <unk> ?
it 's a big range of the quality of the agency for the agency .
we have a <unk> interest .
a very big bandwidth and it 's to be like to introduce our own <unk> .
and the <unk> talent and his illusion of the rapid money has been used to be used to be used for the <unk> of cocaine .
he had always fun to do business .
he 's been used to be arrested for the first time .
and this was not really surprising to me .
the opposite .
he says , he 's going to be able to see his second life .
and he 's been going to be a second time .
he took it to a therapy and then the <unk> .
and he learned how he could be able to use their support for a private talent .
he 's in september 13 , since he was <unk> , he was <unk> to <unk> his business .
the <unk> is , and he can have a lot of life .
he has a good thing .
he 's today today .
who wants to talk to him , and you want to talk about him .
even back to martin , i had to tell him the beginning of the beginning .
martin , after his childhood , he had a education club and he ended up in his room in the room .
and there was <unk> and drugs that are the agenda , it 's pretty fast .
he worked with a <unk> and <unk> .
twenty years ago , he was living in this life .
and he says that he 's going to be a lot of that lifestyle is not aware of their own self-interest .
one day he was carrying someone who was a <unk> that he was convicted of being raped .
he took the most part of the time and the more important life has changed .
he learned to be able to make more more successful and more quality of life without the <unk> without needing to eat or without drugs .
and he was from his sense of his way he wanted to be able to do it .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> .
that 's the same thing .
he 's working on two years , and we have to be our collaborator in their way , because he knows that if you want to change the right tools , and if you 're going to get the right tools that you can get more than often
the basis of these successes are the way they 're like .
people who come to prison in prison are coming to the <unk> of us to get our participants in their own personal care , to their personal plans .
this is our <unk> , the first talks to our education , that are students who are struggling to do the <unk> of the business .
and these are our mentors who are our participants in the <unk> .
and also , these people are going to take a lot of our program .
one example .
we 're going to do our <unk> , which is called the <unk> .
we 're going to put the middle of the room in the middle of the room , and our subjects are on the one and our subjects on the other side .
and i 'm going to ask you different questions .
and every time somebody in the room , there 's a question that 's going to be the line of the line .
and here we see what we all have in the prison room , if we 're in the prison or outside .
but also where the difference is .
and a example of where the differences is , it 's a question .
i 'm in a <unk> social , or i had a family who was in the time .
there are often a lot of our participants in the line , and just very few of our people .
one question i want to do is that all of us , who are all the way to tell you that .
i 'm going to tell you all of you .
maybe we can get a little light in the audience .
i can see you .
it 's all .
great .
thank you .
i 'm going to ask you a question , and if you ask this question , you 'll go to you , otherwise , you 're just going to be easy .
this is the way our line we 're going to go .
i 've been used in my life in my life , i could n't have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it .
if you ask this question , you 're going to ask you .
it 's the <unk> , the <unk> .
it 's also more important to have a little bit of <unk> .
it 's not the way that you 're not going to have to do it .
okay .
and it 's also also , maybe we have n't have to be <unk> to <unk> .
all right .
most of you are sitting .
we have a few of the angels in the room .
this is wonderful , i 'm happy .
thank you , you 're going to get all over you .
and in this question , when we look at the <unk> , we 're going to get a lot of people in the way .
and many of you will be clear , how much happiness might be .
happiness with the parents who are in the environment , with the friends , but they 're not going to be a chance that they 're not going to be caught by the side of the <unk> or something on the other .
what are the results of our work ?
and in fact , our <unk> <unk> in our <unk> are in the <unk> days for the <unk> .
it 's rapidly fast .
and the other percent have been done .
a third of the aid of the most successful year .
and our <unk> is seven percent .
i had been told that the most of seven percent of the <unk> is in germany , in germany , in germany .
i 'm going to be a believer .
a year , it costs a $ 10,000 dollars per year .
and it 's a nice job , which is what a <unk> of seven percent of the most likely to be about a year of average , for a year , for a year .
when my father and i 've been working together , we 've been open to pretty much pretty much of it .
i was in my great business for a big corporation .
but i have to tell you , i did n't have to work in my life .
we encourage our participants to make responsibility .
responsibility , what in your life is , and all of us is to make it about what you 're going to happen in your life .
not to hide , nothing .
because this leads to a new new faith and allows it to make it more confidence .
and so , it makes me very happy and proud of our participants are open to their own way .
i 've got a little video to show you .
film .
so i was convicted of two years , and eight months of dangerous .
i was because of three years to three years and 10 months ago .
i 've got to be <unk> .
so i 've got the judgment of two years because of dangerous .
i was convicted of <unk> and three full-time rights .
so , i mean , in my passion , i 've changed my life .
and what was important for me was that this is the <unk> .
because there was my favorite , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't really interested in , i 'm almost saying , yes .
i 've got to come back to the <unk> .
i 've found a new perspective in front of the front time .
and you 're going to be with a different consciousness and consciousness of the season .
so , it 's still more important to be a fixed goals , and then you 're still going to get back to anything .
with the wrong people , and that 's not more .
well , the problem is that many of you have no <unk> , if the ones that comes out .
the biggest problem because it 's automatically automatically <unk> , you 're going to go back into the old <unk> .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
through this individual individual , whatever it 's all been going to be , i think , just about the whole way , about the way i think about the relationship with the problem with the society that has been just just about the same time in the
i 'm for my first wife , i 'm a little bit of my first wife .
and since i 've got six months , i 'll go back with her .
so , that 's what we 've got to do with a new relationship .
and because i 'm looking at all of these things , and many other things changed .
i 've got to get a lot of .
i 'm with my family in the <unk> of the education .
so i work in my career , i 'm going to say .
i just just want to go to the moment .
you need to realize that it 's very much people who actually actually have to be like for example , but for example , i 've been going to be on the time , and it 's not about the most important , i know , to help people
i 'm grateful for that idea that they 're going to be doing this .
i 'm grateful for that , because they 've been still in trouble with the same , and i 'm extremely grateful that i could be part of it .
and also , of course , the whole people who were doing that .
i 've been told with many people who talked about the ones , and the ones that are doing is that it 's good .
and i 'm going to do it .
and for me , thank you .
come to prison .
each of you have something that we need .
whether they give our participants to their clients , whether they 're going to be more than the first one of us , they 're going to be a financial support for the financial support .
whether you have to build our program in a new job , it 's really important .
let 's talk about this .
martin luther and i 'm today here .
and so , you 're going to talk about the conversation .
thank you .
i 've been interested in the first time for the united states , for the united states , in nepal .
in a time i was a <unk> .
there 's a lot of things that you do .
for the <unk> .
the <unk> .
one of the <unk> <unk> .
there are really many ways to do how you can do with <unk> .
and how you can do it .
anyway , i was <unk> .
and with my work and so , the little bit of the work .
and i really want to talk about this .
and not the real problems .
my problem was i was really interested in the right way , and i could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be 10 years in 10 years .
it was <unk> .
and this particular thing i found was scary .
it 's very good .
basically , i had a <unk> driver of <unk> .
so , how do you work .
i did n't know i did n't want to go to the future ?
do you just feel comfortable ?
or what would i mean if i was going to go back to my new underwear ?
and look at what happens .
what i 'm waiting for .
that was the idea .
i was in this time to be a <unk> .
as i said , `` i 'm going to be <unk> .
the first time was for me to be even more <unk> .
you 're going to make the world in a very good hotels , and the country has to be a very much way in a very much way .
but i also are , but also , very , very much countries .
developing countries where it 's safe to see , and say , as a <unk> villages , you have to be <unk> with the <unk> , although they have nothing to be lucky and joy .
and this images and <unk> and <unk> , but a journey is also a journey .
and that was for me for a while .
i was doing that .
so on the surface .
and also , i found it a little bit of me to talk about a country that i do n't really know .
i wanted to change .
i wanted to do countries .
and to write the paper .
and my personal interest in the quiet .
how do you learn countries ?
by people , you can live with people .
people live in the people .
not in the hotel .
by the challenges with the challenges of people .
and by people , you work with people .
at least the answer was that i could give me this question .
and i wanted to do it .
and i wanted to make something a sense of something .
i wanted to afford a <unk> .
something good .
and this feeling has been still interested in a more <unk> time .
i was often in developing countries , but nepal is just very touched .
and after the fact , there was a <unk> civil war that was not only been made of many orphans of economic and social problems .
with a annual income rate of consumption , the poorest country is in south asia .
and it 's still going to be a half of the poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population is under the poverty .
almost one fifth of the population is malnutrition .
forty percent of the adults ca n't read reading and write .
all these facts are connected with all of personal stories and stories that i 've been on this journey in the journey i was in a time i was ready to be open .
i wanted to change something .
and then , after my <unk> , i 've been trying to find my decision .
i quit my job .
and then i think of aid .
and i 'm going to give you a couple of examples of the answer that i 've been going to have to my research .
because they just had a kind of thing .
it 's a serious issue for the international international company .
and not to be a more successful for a minute , for the moment , we have to be more likely to live in nepal and a funding of their <unk> .
hello ?
is it ?
my research was really serious , and good .
at least i thought .
and this answer was a more successful .
i was really <unk> .
and i was a pretty emotional answer .
and fortunately , i never need to work .
instead , i 'm going to make this very scary feeling to make the good thing .
i used it as a motor , for my own business .
and it 's true .
<unk> , and the same .
a company that 's basically what i found in the time .
and the possibility is to communicate a country .
the possibility to be a country .
by people , i can live with people in the living place .
and not in the way , it 's going to be in <unk> .
and you can be able to use two words .
so , <unk> and <unk> .
so , that means how to do it , you can make good <unk> .
you can do good .
this sounds like a little bit of <unk> .
it 's not .
and it 's a social business business business .
we use tourism as a tool for sustainable development .
and we use more than a tool for sustainable development .
so , the <unk> and tourism .
because people who are going to travel with their <unk> and <unk> their jobs .
they pay for their journey , like a other <unk> .
but they travel .
they 're in the workforce .
and the principle is not much better or much more much more than the real person , but it 's really important to be the <unk> .
social engagement .
and the <unk> .
and so we 're going to give people to our participants in the <unk> , and interests in different projects .
we can have to work with our work in the <unk> of the <unk> , which otherwise otherwise otherwise not a chance to be a <unk> .
because the infrastructure is missing .
and we can do sustainable projects .
we can build own sustainable projects .
so we 're going to take a hundred percent of ourselves .
they 're not on their own .
and this is just our long development of meaning .
we started working with our work in nepal .
in the past , we have our engagement in uganda .
and now after four years ago , i 've been married , and i 've been married , and i 'm a team of a team .
so we 're going to go back to the future ?
or what would we think about that ?
if we have the idea of the right , we have to go on the right ?
if we do n't have to do social engagement and sustainable travel , but in its wholeness , it 's going to be a <unk> ?
and so , with the individual , you have to do the individual ?
or even more <unk> .
so this would be a new company .
a company that 's companies .
but with other , the same philosophy of the same philosophy .
do we want to do that ?
so the next question .
new companies ?
sure we want to be that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 're going to start .
because we 're talking about the same language .
because we 're going to dream the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and so we 've got to have a sister in this year .
and it 's true .
and with the creative business , we 're creative in their development and we 're helping us to support the human people .
and we 're going to give participants the participants , entrepreneurs or employees , and for creative companies to have a global organization .
so , the personal social social and <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the pursuit of the security industry is for the best election .
and there 's also the same thing .
a tool that 's a more powerful thing to have a more powerful advantage .
he shows a little bit in a short time where you 're going to die or where you 're going to be .
where you might have the <unk> <unk> .
where you might be able to do it , you 're going to be able to think about it .
and he shows a thing that you 're right .
and then it 's a <unk> of his eyes .
it 's the creativity that suddenly have a great great .
or it 's the <unk> that you 've been discovering in .
the <unk> things do n't change .
and the force to change things that can change .
and you can change a lot of change .
it 's very short .
we know that .
one example .
this is the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this is five , wonderful women in uganda .
with <unk> and talent .
they <unk> beautiful , <unk> , for years .
and since years , nothing happened .
because they did n't have a market .
because they did n't know how they can improve the quality .
because you have no one said , what design might be in the question .
we wanted to help these women .
and so , this year is a year .
and more importantly , the <unk> .
products people get out of poverty .
you give them a income .
a future .
we 've been talking about our <unk> lives .
and we start with a first time .
a more <unk> child , from a thousand of our women .
for the market , you do n't just give you a year .
but it allows us to make a lot more bigger .
this first , a <unk> of social <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> .
so who wants to help you , that you can make a stick with the rest of the other , but it 's also going to be on the project .
he can travel to the women and more active .
so we do n't want to do five women in a work , or a few years .
and that 's not just in uganda , but in nepal , and in the other , we 're working in the same work .
but this is just this one project of our integrated space .
we work in all the central areas .
in the region , and health and health and health and <unk> .
because the work is just just a little bit .
what happens with the kids who work ?
right .
so we 've been in this year in nepal , and in uganda , two <unk> <unk> .
everything is in our cycle .
and the whole sense of more sense , as every single project .
participants are in the different projects .
the same opportunity to have all the way to work in the common work .
and i want to leave you on a journey .
and i 'm going to tell you the eyes .
imagine you 're in africa .
in rural , in uganda .
you 're sitting on a wooden table .
and they 're happy and sick .
you 've got to go with your family lunch .
it was more .
and it 's true .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
here 's it <unk> .
you have to get out of the window .
and look at the <unk> of the <unk> .
their <unk> foot is <unk> on the sand .
you need to be on your job .
and you 're also going to see a thin layer of the dust .
the children are laughing .
and call the fun <unk> .
you 're not going to tell you you 're not going to call it more .
and it 's true .
you do n't know how late it is .
but soon , you 'll get you to you .
and the quality of the kids , the children were going to be married .
the end of the street is a big tree .
here you 're going to meet you with <unk> .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of the tree is going to be the new design of their <unk> .
how do you get your hands with hands and feet .
later , the other women are going to be .
they smile .
you know , you know , you know , you know your english car .
under the tree .
in free .
unbelievable , there 's still the internet .
tomorrow , you get your coach .
you 're going to get you .
the exchange is worth caring .
and also , it 's really nice to speak again .
you 're hearing music .
and that 's the <unk> of the <unk> .
mom <unk> is the <unk> in the courtyard .
she sings a <unk> song .
you 're relaxed , and happy .
you can make your eyes back .
everyone can come to us to be a new <unk> .
or at least , at least , you 'll take a short time to go back to the <unk> .
and what happens .
thank you .
before i start , i 'd like to talk to you , if you 're going to talk about you , you 've got a little <unk> house .
i do n't know that the light does n't seem to be good , but maybe someone wants to be someone else .
here 's a little guy .
two .
here 's a little bit of , but i 'm not going to be there , but there 's two times here , that 's beautiful , we 're going to be on .
i 've got a building , and the <unk> mountain is the middle of the city .
this is the building .
and together , with 20 other people , i 've been going to have the <unk> last summer in the last summer .
and so i 'm going to leave you here .
well , you might say some of you might say .
what is it going to do ?
and there 's a lot of time .
but i want to explain it .
so what does you have to do ?
and you have to go in the park or how ?
just a little bit of questions that we 've been known to have , friends , and when you 've learned that i 've been part of the initiative that i 've been going to have to say , `` something , ''
all of the way we had to do was that we had the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and here we 've been working on this <unk> <unk> , and they had <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and to the privatization of this <unk> .
but who knows that this is not my kind of <unk> .
and it was not the elected <unk> of the initiative .
what we see here is a sign of the <unk> in the <unk> .
this is a public space , which is private , and so many people not have to be able to do it , but not in public hand , and not so it can be used as you can use public spaces .
we were a group of private companies in the desire to maintain their health and <unk> , and sustainable , and sustainable .
and we wanted to tell another story .
we were a <unk> team and that has to be quite short , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the <unk> architecture , urban social -- politics -- and more importantly , , , , , , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and women .
and of course , in the same way , with different social cultural and personal .
our perspectives , and <unk> , and <unk> .
and we have to do it , but also , different networks , but also different networks .
and creative part of our solutions in the field we have to have to have to be able to do it .
we actually have to be able to <unk> the <unk> .
but it was that we 've been doing that we 're going to be <unk> and ideas .
we have memories and images .
and these memories and images are trying to develop different perspectives for the <unk> .
it was really important that the process is always <unk> .
we 're going to be more than initiative as an initiative , and we 're going to be more than a <unk> platform and as a more <unk> .
so , it was a <unk> and <unk> and a <unk> and a <unk> .
and the experiences that we 've done , i 've been doing that , i 've got to go to the evening .
every city has been <unk> .
the one is a face .
in many cases , they were used to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the result of the citizens of the citizens .
they are the dead places in a city because they 're not often the equivalent of what we 're in a public space .
so for example , we have to have more <unk> .
but this , but also , the public , the urban places , that 's often a lot of <unk> .
initiatives like that , they 're still going to be able to stay in the <unk> , and they 're still in the <unk> .
what i do is to do it , like some questions , some questions like some questions .
i mean , a lot of .
these places are not just a face .
no .
they are the social places in our city , where our social lives is living .
so we 're going to do that as we often have to get the first of our neighbors , if we 're looking at the way we 're going to meet the way we go to the way we meet .
and can you be able to be able to make a way that we 're going to be able to sit in and actually do that if the spaces are also designed .
and we 've got to have the same <unk> .
and it 's going to be <unk> , sometimes , sometimes .
but what 's a sense of community .
the more i would have to be in a public space , and the more the the way it 's going to be the community of the community .
and if i do n't want to be , you 'll be able to figure out what you 're going to call the <unk> of a city .
we were going to be two challenges .
we can be able to be able to be the citizens , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood or in the world .
how can it be <unk> in a form of creation ?
how can it be <unk> in ideas ?
the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and not even as the same ones , the same places .
imagine you 're sitting here , you 're going to read the newspaper , and read the newspaper .
love and citizens , we want to be able to give you three different examples of the <unk> of the <unk> that we 've been going to have to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
they can have to give you the idea of an option .
and the idea of most of the most successful is <unk> .
would you go ?
would anybody think of this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds pretty good .
there 's a way to do that .
you can have to be able to look at the future .
and as said , it sounds pretty good at the first moment .
i 'm trying to tell me a explanation .
and because i think you 're not really interested in the really important or or <unk> , and it 's more important .
first because i 'm going to get a lot of <unk> to a lot of time .
that means , mostly , they do n't have any chance to make their own or basic alternatives , but it 's actually a lot of design , and you can have to decide whether they 're going to be more relevant or in the urban green areas .
or as a friend , what color is the <unk> of the <unk> .
second explanation is about the <unk> of information and the vote .
think about three <unk> .
we have to show you what we want to do and you can choose them .
frustration and <unk> are often the consequences that i think it 's kind of irrelevant .
i do n't want to be a decision to be more interested in the moment or more than i 'd actually been able to do it as much as a better idea of war .
but it 's also different .
although we 've been looking at the same time , we 've got to have a lot of people , we 've got to have a lot of <unk> .
and so we 've got to share the experiences and i want to share with others .
i want to share it with other initiatives , other projects , but also , and in the city and the politics .
because the ones that are really important to be actually actually actually used to be the ones that are actually responsible for these processes .
if it really really really interested in a business , how it 's often <unk> and it will need to be the <unk> , and then we need to get the new new interest .
but i 'm not going to tell you , but i 'm going to tell you all that you 're sitting here .
and because i 'm really important for it .
i 'm going to give you it for important , and i want to give you to our example , to give you a chance to give you a chance .
and i 'm all of them , because they are who they 're going to pay the one to the new demand .
so we have to look at the citizens , and to be the citizens of the citizens , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood and to be engaged and <unk> ?
first , the first time is to play on a <unk> game .
in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , citizens , citizens , and different interests .
what we see here is a <unk> that we 've invited to have .
what we see here is some of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the conversation .
the goal must be to be able to be able to get this conversation on a game that is not the interest or the skills to have the skills of the citizens .
the citizens are experts in the place they are experts to do their neighborhood , what they 're doing is what they 're doing with a place where a place is in the middle of a place where they 're not going to be a place .
the most important thing , in the city , what is going to be in the city of the project , which is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
in the case , in a particular case , there 's another other <unk> that are going to be the topics that are going to be on the project that 's coming out .
all of the information is to be all of the information that all information is accessible to all the place and the place that we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
by can you can be able to get the <unk> of the place that you can get a very positive place .
a dialogue is a little bit more likely to play , which is the best people are going to be seriously .
and then , if somebody says , i want to be a <unk> next to the <unk> .
that can be in a <unk> , but the goal needs to be to be in the first time , but what 's the right solution , but maybe the right solution , but maybe in the other place .
how said that it 's coming out of the dialogue .
second , we 're different .
our <unk> is very colorful .
one feels like it 's a <unk> , if he 's going to be a big group of <unk> and talk .
one other can do , but you might not want to be able to talk about the text of the <unk> group .
one other might be familiar or <unk> .
or it 's going to be your ideas in the workforce .
what i want to say is to be different to help different groups of people .
we have to be looking for the possibility of the possibility , just to be , but what happens .
in the background , small show .
we have to have the possibility to be .
we have the possibility to paint .
we have the possibility to write .
regardless of the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had the possibility to connect our ideas with their ideas to be more ideas .
and the possibility of all of the interest is to be more important to be more important .
that can be for example to be a more important thing that can happen to the moment that it 's going to happen to the moment .
and the <unk> and transparent availability of the results is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
we 've got the whole process on facebook , and on a <unk> blog , and the same news is about a <unk> <unk> .
our third point is .
you remember that i said that i was going to be a lot of time .
in my first event , i had three <unk> <unk> .
but the process is , but only though , it 's the process of the process , and the best self is not going to know what to be with the <unk> area .
when it 's through the dialogue , and i 'm going to be back to the point of the problem , which is what the problem is going to come in a area .
and the best part of the world is also to be true .
and then , if you were not beginning to be the first thing that the <unk> was looking at this , and it was the experience of the previous <unk> .
what happens when citizens are going to be <unk> and their city .
it 's already in a lot of projects .
i 've heard this one for the moment that it 's the most important , probably , in many of the familiar .
in new york , it was a project , which is a <unk> .
in fact , in the case , there 's been three weeks in the <unk> of six weeks to have the funding to be able to do the funding for the best election .
the time in august was not able to do the science of the world , not unlike the idea of their own own .
and the most important in new york , i do n't have to say , because he 's going to have a lot of the most important world in the city , not an idea of politics or the government .
the opposite is the most important ones for the highest ones .
in the case , we 're going to go back back to germany , in germany , the citizens had been able to get a place in the middle of a place .
the city had been told , not to be needed .
the four weeks of the time we 've been working for for three years , the most successful thing is to be more than the <unk> .
today , the city is the city .
while the side of the <unk> has been <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the city that has the initiative that has been <unk> and other .
in the <unk> , their own <unk> <unk> on the street .
in rotterdam , a <unk> <unk> .
all right , so , you want to say , `` well , you 're going to say .
so we 're going to go on this .
but i think it 's wrong to be the city of responsibility .
why ?
because you have a look for you , you have to have a look for it .
while the <unk> , there are citizens or companies in the rule of a way for a form of interest in a form of business , the city of the <unk> for projects that are on the side of the attention .
and for other course , the city of the projects is to be different , and they 're going to be able to use other tools .
one of the security is just a <unk> initiative .
and our goal was to be a little initiative that was going to be a little bit of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the city was going to be a <unk> of the city .
and this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> in january .
it 's going to go .
so we 've been able to do that problem that we ca n't have to be able to do that .
but we know that we know that the city is successful , if the <unk> successful successful , if we 're successful , that 's a more successful way .
in the form of the shape , it 's also open .
to finally , i 'm convinced that many projects that are important because of their importance , and also the cost of the city has been developed to have a chance to be a chance to make a lot of <unk> .
if you just go at time and in the dialogue , the citizens will be going to be more competitive .
in the city , and citizens .
in the city of city and you all want you to sit here tonight .
if we do our business , and the same time the leaders of the citizens , the citizens would not be more than a <unk> , but as a <unk> .
it was .
yesterday , after the <unk> , we were working in the hospital and in the room , and they 've been in the workforce .
we talked about it .
so this idea , if you have to have a second chance , if it 's not just that life , it 's just a second opportunity .
we found it really exciting .
and we were very quickly waiting to agree that there are two things that we do n't want to experience .
this is the puberty .
the second thing was , the second time , the <unk> in the table , in the school ?
no .
no .
school , some of you may have to be rejected .
now , i 'm so , so , now , this is the most important time , but the words are going to tell me to me .
my neck was <unk> and i just want to go back to the <unk> .
and then i do n't know how it was in my exams , and i was always the same time that i had to be the <unk> of the <unk> , and i was going to be on the <unk> .
no idea what 's actually going to be in the fact .
they 're going to understand it , so i was n't quite beautiful and after i had my last time i had never been completely , never back to school .
and what i 'm going to say is , if i 'm going to spend the year of the most beautiful days i 've spent time , i 've spent schools .
and with great passion and totally <unk> .
how did it come ?
how could that happen ?
so that 's just what i did with that thing that i could n't do .
i got kids .
so my wife was the children .
and so , it was also clear that it 's the one that was to care about this .
until the day , you said , `` you 're going to be <unk> .
and today you go .
yes , it 's true .
i opened the door and then i was sitting in this room and whoa , i felt in the <unk> .
so this looked like this , as it was in the way we looked at it .
and the <unk> as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as
and when i told the teacher , you know , they know , kids do n't learn for school , but for the reason i 've got to tell me , oh my god , i 'm not going to have the <unk> .
what is that what we 're doing from school , in the school , i 've been doing this in the life of the life ?
so many of us have been really interested in the right way .
where you 've actually got to have your life in your life , right ?
and maybe some of the capital is the capital of the <unk> <unk> .
what is the <unk> <unk> ?
or , in fact , that 's a little bit of a lot of time in a short time , and i can have to be able to do it in a <unk> , and i can get it to a <unk> , and i 'm going to be
well , i did that , for the time , but otherwise , it 's going to be true ?
and what 's a more important one of the one is a point of a moment of someone who 's a good doctor ?
whether the <unk> is , and if you have the good <unk> properties ?
no .
so , it 's not , for life , not for school .
so when we look at this , we 've been going to be over the last century , the <unk> of the <unk> , because it 's the <unk> .
that 's the time in germany , in germany , the first time was completely introduced .
and where the school system we 've been today is , it 's its roots .
and when we think about time , it was actually that people had n't had any time to know their time .
and there were four or six years that they were forced to go to school , and they were going to be able to be able to do the only possibility that the people who had to know and the facts and the information of their time .
today , a more more information in its pocket than the largest library of the time .
and the middle of the 19th century was the time the <unk> .
that means , there 's a lot of change in the world and there were all people who could have these new machines .
but at the same time , people need to get the machines and fix these machines .
and we needed people who could build these machines and the factories .
maybe you know it .
the public school system that we 've been in germany in germany , and it has to be its root in this time .
and it 's made it made .
because it was really that it was really that what i 've been doing in school , which is the work of the work that the <unk> who was in the <unk> , who was the <unk> of his life .
we 're going to go to the future .
let 's start the first century , where it 's , and we 're going to look at the year .
the year was the year that was first time to be just <unk> .
i was working with my research and thought , well , now , you 're going to go to your first company , the first company .
yes , after some of me , i 'm going to go to the internet , i 've got to go to the same time , and i 'm going to be able to do it .
and some companies are in us and more and bigger and bigger and we are so beautiful , and some of the companies are going to be in the <unk> .
you see it 's two times in life .
and we had a few years ago , and we had 30 years ago .
so , we had a beautiful growth and we 've been so much more powerful to the <unk> of the <unk> , and we need to be more successful .
i do n't know if you have a concrete idea , what people do , but when i was in school , we had no idea that it would be what we would ever be .
even as i was working , i was like the internet , not a talk .
and the kids who are going to do today in school , who are going to be 10 , or 30 years , or 30 years ago ?
the only honest answer is we have no idea .
and what do you know what are the facts will be to be successful in this future ?
and if you 're honest , there 's the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're in the future of the future , i could have to be the <unk> for the <unk> .
it 's the <unk> , i read .
well , you know , you have no idea .
how do we get out of what school is doing ?
what are the things that we need to do for children to make life ?
and maybe it helps me to look at what companies are looking for for employees .
that 's the most successful school , yes ?
the schools of schools and universities are in the company .
and if you look at this , you have to see the <unk> , you know , there 's the first thing that we do .
so , the ones that you want to do is , we 're going to be looking at the same , we 've got to spend three years to work with 10 years , and then 12 years abroad .
and that will be going to be able to do school and also not afford to afford .
but what i could do is , but maybe the things that are important , that the most important thing is that the most important thing is , and i 'm convinced that that is that the most important thing that we have to be the future of the
and you can basically get in three groups .
this is a company that you have to be <unk> , and you 're a <unk> , so you 're a <unk> .
and then , you know , all of the companies have been <unk> to <unk> .
and then , these companies have been <unk> .
so we have to be trained and <unk> , and they 're going to be <unk> .
let 's start with the flexibility .
that 's relatively fast .
if we look at how economies works today , how fast how fast changes .
and , all of the models are in the internet of the internet on the morning .
and there 's a lot of education that i can do with this change .
there 's a lot of <unk> , i have to be creative .
there 's a lot of education , i have to be <unk> .
this is pretty exactly the opposite of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
the second thing is that the second thing is relatively clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's people who are responsible for people .
first time , and your own life .
but also , the big whole thing .
whether this is the company or also as a society , we want to make people responsible for the great whole whole whole thing .
and the third factor , the most important thing that is going to be the most important thing .
and if we remember the football world , there was the internet .
argentina has been elected in the '50s , and germany has been a team .
it was not <unk> , the world won the world .
that could be the only thing .
and also , this great <unk> of our time , steve jobs , and it 's really , .
it was n't the iphone that invented the iphone , which has n't invented the <unk> of the <unk> , not invented by the invented of it .
and the team that was done that it was done because only as a team could have done what they did .
so , so , i mean , the three things that you could do is that you can do that , for example , for the time , we 're going to learn to live in the life .
but there 's still the fourth thing , and it 's almost more important .
and that 's the learning self .
if the only thing we can say about the future is that you 're not insecure , but the ability to learn to learn to learn and learn to learn that this is what we 're going to live in the future and our children in their lives are
this is what 's going to do for the <unk> , that these things are <unk> .
but where was i ?
i was in this room and the children who have to know that this is not just a <unk> event that you need to pay for .
so , this is what i said , `` well , i 've been not all of the word , but not all of everyone .
until the moment , where the <unk> will be going to be going to be all invisible , then all of the invisible .
yes , i sat out , and what i say is that i was going to say that the most of my kids were going to be the <unk> of the event .
less fun was it for me when when you want to talk about the topic of the topic , and learning about the whole family .
and even less fun , when the child gets sick , because they 're going to be high .
and finally , it was the same , and it was a peak of this time to this school , and this is the same thing that we 've been going to do with this school .
so , it was n't a more , so it was so much more , so that was so much the last hour , and in fact , we were the only parents who were invited to be invited .
and i 'm going to tell you , and i 'm going to tell you the details of the time that we have to do our child , that 's not going to do it .
but for the two years , we 've been working on that , because it 's not something that 's not happening .
what do we do ?
and we had to ask ourselves the question of our child ?
and are we the only thing that 's going to do ?
i 've been in the last two years since i 've been talking about the topic of a lot of people , and i 've been able to have learned that i 've been not alone .
there are all a lot of things that it 's very similar , and it was two years ago , i was working with the <unk> , we were just trying to have a new business for reasons , where we 're going to go on the journey ,
and what i say , he has almost been telling me the same story with a child , he has almost been the same thing as we know , and we had that lucky we have to be able to do the kids , and we were going to
in berlin , there 's a lot of different schools , and we could even go back to the other schools .
but can anybody do anything ?
somehow , we were just trying to make our children in security and that <unk> of the way that they 're going to be like .
and after we 've been looking at the idea , we 've been looking at the same time , we were n't really interested in , we 're good , so we 're the first time that we 've been doing the first time .
just how to do it as much as we do something ?
the good is that we need to be deceived .
we 're not alone .
but we 've been relatively fast for a lot of great people who wanted to figure out what we wanted to do , which is how we do , to create the whole world that we 're going to make all of the world .
it 's not that that 's just the children and their parents suffer under the suffering , which is what happens in common .
if we look at the teachers , 30 percent of the teachers have been working .
if we look at the number of the past , the last 10 years has changed the year .
can you be able to do that all parents ?
all children are all the children , and they are still the teacher ?
or can it be that we have a school system that does n't just have to be so much like this , as this libertarian has been just more important , but it 's not really much more right .
and we 've found many people found that it was like , and we have found people who did n't have children .
and they 've understood that they need responsibility for the future for responsibility for the future , for responsibility for the future , and the children who are going to go to school , and they 're going to go to the way they go to the way .
and we 've got to have the second thing there 's there there 's there there , there 's all kinds of great initiatives to change school , and there are there , and there are all schools , and there 's really great , and there 's almost
and there 's even a other <unk> of <unk> , who 's the first step to go to the first step .
and how should we do that ?
we did n't have a concept that we could do .
but we can do a thing that we can do in these schools , and we can do these schools , who are the parents , the teacher , the teacher and students , and we can do them with two days .
so there are people who are working in the past , and they have to learn the same thing to work in two days , which is working with work .
and the first thing we 're going to do is to get the same challenge to the challenge of the brain .
and after two days , the next year , for example , for a new consumer , or the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> , for a new school , we 've been going to be able to talk about a virtual school .
or the way we have to do is have a lot of things that they 've been doing in their school , they 've been evolving in their school .
within two days , we 've been able to build the next day in the next day .
but what 's the most important thing that this two days is , and it makes it for me that i 'm so beautiful for the little weekends i 've been doing , and then i spent in schools in the world , that 's the energy that we
if the three things are in common , what is how to create a <unk> .
so , they 're kind of like the <unk> and when they experience a team .
then this is a <unk> , <unk> .
and when we went four weeks to the next time , we 've been going to learn to go back to the school , that the school was going to change the world that has been completely new culture .
and this is incredibly hot .
and i 'm going to invite you to go to school .
i need to invite you to go to school .
and i 'm also interested in all of them , to talk about school .
talk about what you do , but you do n't want to do what you do .
they 're surprised to be surprised how much they get , and how many people have seen the same , but not it 's not about it .
let 's let us take each one of us in germany in germany .
let 's change the entire education system .
and let 's do that with the people who spend the day for the day , and the parents who are teachers and students .
because only we can do that .
thank you .
